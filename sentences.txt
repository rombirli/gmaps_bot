akron bbs trial update: dangerous precedents in sysop prosecution

you may already know about the bbs 'sting' six months ago in munroe
falls, oh for "disseminating matter harmful to juveniles." those
charges were dropped for lack of evidence. now a trial date of
1/4/93 has been set after new felony charges were filed, although
the pretrial hearing revealed no proof that *any* illegal content
ever went out over the bbs, nor was *any* found on it.

for those unfamiliar with the case, here's a brief summary to date.
in may 1992 someone told munroe falls police they *thought* minors
could have been getting access to adult materials over the akron
anomaly bbs. police began a 2-month investigation. they found a
small number of adult files in the non-adult area.

the sysop says he made a clerical error, causing those files to be
overlooked. normally adult files were moved to a limited-access
area with proof of age required (i.e. photostat of a drivers
license).

police had no proof that any minor had actually accessed those
files so police logged onto the bbs using a fictitious account,
started a download, and borrowed a 15-year old boy just long enough
to press the return key. the boy had no knowledge of what was going
on.

police then obtained a search warrant and seized lehrer's bbs
system. eleven days later police arrested and charged sysop mark
lehrer with "disseminating matter harmful to juveniles," a
misdemeanor usually used on bookstore owners who sell the wrong
book to a minor. however, since the case involved a computer,
police added a *felony* charge of "possession of criminal tools"
(i.e. "one computer system").

note that "criminal tool" statutes were originally intended for
specialized tools such as burglar's tools or hacking paraphenalia
used by criminal 'specialists'. the word "tool" implies deliberate
use to commit a crime, whereas the evidence shows (at most) an
oversight. this raises the constitutional issue of equal protection
under the law (14'th amendment). why should a computer hobbyist be
charged  with a felony when anyone else would be charged with a
misdemeanor?

at the pretrial hearing, the judge warned the prosecutor that
they'd need "a lot more evidence than this" to convict. however the
judge allowed the case to be referred to a summit county grand
jury, though there was no proof the sysop had actually
"disseminated", or even intended to disseminate any adult material 
"recklessly, with knowledge of its character or content", as the
statute requires. indeed, the sysop had a long history of
*removing* such content from the non-adult area whenever he became
aware of it. this came out at the hearing.

the prosecution then went on a fishing expedition. according to the
cleveland plain dealer (7/21/92)

    "[police chief] stahl said computer experts with the ohio
bureau of criminal identification and investigation are reviewing
the hundreds of computer files seized from lehrer's home. stahl 
said it's possible that some of the games and movies are being
accessed in violation of copyright laws."

obviously the police believe they have carte blanche to search
unrelated personal files, simply by lumping all the floppies and
files in with the computer as a "criminal tool." that raises
constitutional issues of whether the search and seizure was legal.
that's a precedent which, if not challenged, has far-reaching
implications for *every* computer owner.

also, bbs access was *not* sold for money, as the cleveland plain
dealer reports. the bbs wasn't a business, but rather a free
community service, running on lehrer's own computer, although extra
time on the system could be had for a donation to help offset some
of the operating costs. 98% of data on the bbs consists of
shareware programs, utilities, e-mail, etc.

the police chief also stated:

    "i'm not saying it's obscene because i'm not getting into that
battle, but it's certainly not appropriate for kids, especially
without parental permission," stahl said.

note the police chief's admission that obscenity wasn't an issue at
the time the warrant was issued.


here the case *radically* changes direction. the charges above were
dropped. however, while searching the 600 floppy disks seized along
with the bbs, police found five picture files they think *could* be
depictions of borderline underage women; although poor picture
quality makes it difficult to tell.

the sysop had *removed* these unsolicited files from the bbs hard
drive after a user uploaded them. however the sysop didn't think to
destroy the floppy disk backup, which was tossed into a cardboard
box with hundreds of others. this backup was made before he erased
the files off the hard drive.

the prosecution, lacking any other charges that would stick, is
using these several floppy disks to charge the sysop with two new
second-degree felonies, "pandering obscenity involving a minor",
and "pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor" (i.e. 
kiddie porn, prison sentence of up to 25 years).

the prosecution produced no evidence the files were ever
"pandered". there's no solid expert testimony that the pictures
depict minors. all they've got is the opinion of a local
pediatrician.
all five pictures have such poor resolution that there's no way to
tell for sure to what extent makeup or retouching was used. a
digitized image doesn't have the fine shadings or dot density of a
photograph, which means there's very little detail on which to base
an expert opinion. the digitization process also modifies and
distorts the image during compression.

the prosecutor has offered to plea-bargain these charges down to
"possession" of child porn, a 4'th degree felony sex crime
punishable by one year in prison. the sysop refuses to plead guilty
to a sex crime. mark lehrer had discarded the images for which the
city of munroe falls adamantly demands a felony conviction. this
means the first "pandering" case involving a bbs is going to trial
in *one* month, jan 4th.

the child porn statutes named in the charges contain a special
exemption for libraries, as does the original "dissemination to
juveniles" statute (orc # 2907.321 & 2). the exemption presumably
includes public and privately owned libraries available to the
public, and their disk collections. this protects library owners
when an adult item is misplaced or loaned to a minor. (i.e. 8 year
olds can rent r-rated movies from a public library).

yet although this sysop was running a file library larger than a
small public library, he did not receive equal protection under the
law, as guaranteed by the 14'th amendment. neither will any other
bbs, if this becomes precedent. the 'library  defense' was allowed
for large systems in cubby versus compuserve, based on a previous
obscenity case (smith vs. california), in which the supreme court
ruled it generally unconstitutional to hold bookstore owners liable
for content, because that would place an undue burden on bookstores
to review every book they carry, thereby 'chilling' the
distribution of books and infringing the first amendment.

if the sysop beats the bogus "pandering" charge, there's still
"possession", even though he was *totally unaware* of what was on
an old backup floppy, unsolicited in the first place, found unused
in a cardboard box. "possession" does not require knowledge that
the person depicted is underage. the law presumes anyone in
possession of such files must be a pedophile. the framers of the
law never anticipated sysops,or that a sysop would routinely be
receiving over 10,000 files from over 1,000 users.

the case could set a far ranging statewide and nationwide precedent
whether or not the sysop is innocent or guilty, since he and his
family might lack the funds to fight this--after battling to get
this far.

these kinds of issues are normally resolved in the higher courts--
and *need* to be resolved, lest this becomes commonplace anytime
the police or a prosecutor want to intimidate a bbs, snoop through
users' electronic mail, or "just appropriate someone's computer for
their own use."

you, the reader, probably know a sysop like mark lehrer. you and
your family have probably enjoyed the benefits of bbs'ing. you may
even have put one over on a busy sysop now and then.

in this case; the sysop is a sober and responsible college student,
studying computer science and working to put himself through
school. he kept his board a lot cleaner than could be reasonably 
expected, so much so that the prosecution can find very little to
fault him for.


*important*  please consider a small contribution to ensure a fair
trial and precedent, with standards of evidence upheld, so that
mere possession of a computer is not grounds for a witch hunt.

these issues must not be decided by the tactics of a 'war of
attrition'; *however far* in the court system this needs to go. for
this reason, an independent, legal defense trust fund has been set
up by concerned area computer users, cpa's, attorneys,etc.

          the constitution's 1st amendment and the 9th amendment clearly
          addresses this issue. this case is another case of the actual "police
          power" against americans.
          there is no crime here! there is no property damaged and there is no
          human victim here. then there should be no crime but our present

          on here.

"new jersey group debates on-line censorship"  (c) copyright 1984 "computer
living new york" by jonathan d. wallace
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
despite the recent indictment of california sysop, tom tcimpidis, because of a
stolen credit card number a user had posted on his bulletin board, the new
jersey amateur computer group has announced its plans to establish bulletin
board on which there will be "absolutely no censorship."

"the board of directors had voted to do this before the tcimpidis  matter
broke," said harry van tassell, president of the ten-year-old group,  "and
we're not going to chicken out now."  the uncensored board will be one  of
several boards the club will establish on a multi-year system.  messages  left
by users will be automatically erased by the system after a certain  period of
time has passed, but the board will have no sysop, and no one  will review
messages posted on the board by users.

"once you start censoring the contents of a board," van tassell  said, "where
do you stop?  with stolen credit card messages?  messages that  include
four-letter words?  messages that you disagree with politically?   the only
thing that's worse than the government coming in and censoring  you, is an
atmosphere in which people start censoring themselves."

van tassell made his remarks at a december 7th meeting of the  group, held at
union county community college in cranford, new jersey.   during the meeting, a
panel of sysops and lawyers debated the question of  censorship of electronic
bulletin boards.  the sysop members on the panel
-- hank lee, recently named "computer living new york's man of the year"  and
bill kaiser, who runs a board in southern new jersey -- both took issue  with
the group's plan to run an uncensored board.

kee, sysop of the new york amateur computer club board in new york  city, said
that he had started off with van tassell's attitude that a sysop  ought not to
tamper with the messages left by users.  he was quickly  disabused by users who
uploaded copyrighted software to his board and left  anonymous obscene
messages.  "when i'm away," kee said, "my eleven-year-old  son monitors the
board.  there were things on there i didn't want him to  see."

kaiser predicted that the group would be shocked by the behavior of  some of
the users attracted to the board.  "if you're going to put up such  a board,
you don't want your name connected with it... wait until you see  the messages
you get.  if you want a reputation as an educational public  service board, you
have to review the board's contents."

kaiser felt that a sysop has "a responsibility to ourselves and our  users to
monitor the contents of our boards.  i think tcimpidis was  irresponsible for
leaving a credit card message on his board.  and if he  didn't read the
message, he was irresponsible for not reading it."

van tassell wasn't concerned about being shocked.  "my solution to  that," he
said cheerfully, "is not to read the messages on the board."   noting the large
memory-capacity of a multiuser system, he added: "as a  practical matter,
unless you want to spend a tremendous amount of time, you  just can't go
through and read everything and decide you don't like what  this guy said."

both kaiser and kee said that they spend about two hours a day  reading their
boards, reviewing as many as forty or sixty messages left  from the day before.
both sysops also have other security measures  implemented.  "when you first
sign on my board," kee said, "you can only  leave me a message telling me you
want to register.  once you're verified,  you can upload and download."  he
does not permit users to register with  fictitious names or to use such names
in leaving messages.

steve leon, an attorney and member of the group's board of  directors,
expressed the hope that honest users would call to inform the  group of any
illegal messages, such as the credit card message that caused  tom tcimpidis to
be indicted.  he indicated that despite the "no  censorship" stance, such
messages would be deleted from the board.

panelist alan bell of the american civil liberties union advised  the
organization that "you are going to have to review the contents of your  board,
unless you are looking for a test case."  he recommended, however,  that the
"least restrictive approach" be used.  "for example, a ringback  system is too
restrictive."

bell agreed with the sysops that they had a right to monitor their  baords.
"the sysop can say, 'this is my party and i make the rules.'"  he  noted that
the test cases in this new area of the law will all involve  "permissive sysops
who say to their users, 'you can do anything you want.'"

the panel's other attorney was walter timpone, an assistant united  states
attorney from newark who has prosecuted computer crime cases.  "i  would never
have authorized the search warrant in the tcimpidis case,"  timpone said.  "i
don't think there's criminal liability there."  although  tcimpidis may have
been negligent in permitting a credit card message to  remain on his system,
timpone notes that the california law under which  tcimpidis is charged bars
intentional, and not merely negligent, behavior.   however, a sysop who fails
to police his board may have civil liability if  a person injured by an illegal
or libellous message on the board brings  suit against him.

timpone compared the sysops' civil liability for negligence to that  of a
supermarket which is sued by a shopper who slips on a banana peel in  the
store.  in such cases, the courts ask how long the banana peel was left  on the
floor; the longer the time, the greater the store's negligence for  failing to
remove it.  similarly, timpone said, "if a message is up on a  bulletin board
for a week, or five weeks, the responsibility becomes more  obvious."

the tcimpidis case won't reach trial until next year, but the  california
sysop, to whom i spoke last week, gives other sysops the  following advice: "
watch everything like a hawk."  he has implemented  security measures on his
mogur board similar to those described by hank kee
-- to prevent any repetition of the incident that has cost him so much time
and expense since last may.

a random and informal polling i conducted of sysops and users  indicates that
most sysops feel the way kaiser, kee and tcimpidis do --  that the sysop has a
right to review the messages users leave and ought to  do so either out of
public responsibility or to fend off legal problems  such as tcimpidis is
suffering.

some users disagree and feel that electronic messages left by  computer ought
to be protected against intrusion in the same way united  states mail is.
subscribers of compuserve were recently distressed when  allegations surfaced
that the company had deleted email messages  advertising a rival service.  the
messages contained references which  compuserve felt were likely to confuse
recipients into thinking that  compuserve sponsored or endorsed the rival
service.

within a few days of the incident, compuserve denied that any  messages were
deleted, and affirmed its policy never to read or delete  users' private
electronic mail.  nevertheless, the censorship allegations  resulted in a great
deal of debate on several of compuserve's special  interst groups, and also on
the source, whose users followed the dispute  with great interest.

as one message on the source pointed out, new laws have to be  passed before
electronic mail carriers such as mci, the source and  compuserve have true
"common carrier" status.  a carrier such as the  telephone company is forbidden
from monitoring messages.  moreover, such  carriers are shielded from legal
liability if criminals use the service to  transfer illegal information.  a
number of users of the two services  indicated that they would like to see the
services officially be granted  common carrier status.

the sysop of one compuserve sig called for a distinction to be made  between
sigs and small bulletin boards, on the one hand, and mass private  electronic
mail services, on the other.  "a sig or bulletin board is more  like a
publication, which should be reviewed for content," he said.   "email, on the
other hand, is more similar to the united states mail or any  other common
carrier and ought to be left alone."

one thing on which all the new jersey amateur computer group  panelists, and
all compuserve and source users who discussed these  questions, agreed: the
laws governing on-line behavior are still being  written.  in ten years the
answer may all be clear, but at present these  issues are far from settled.

the 250 billion dollar political cover up

the cornerstone of george bush's 1988 presidential campaign was "read my
lips; no new taxes."  the truth about the scope of the savings and loan
scandal would have revealed the hypocrisy of that statement and
threatened bush's candidacy.

now, as a result of a major investigation by the center for
investigative reporting and pbs frontline, we have learned that the
taxpayers could have been saved at least $250 billion if there hadn't
been a political coverup.

in the late summer of 1988, federal home loan (fhl) bank board member
roger martin had a lunch meeting in the private office of william
seidman, then head of the fdic.  elise paylan, roger martin's executive
assistant, also was at the meeting, and reported the following:

"during the meeting with bill seidman, they were discussing the size of
the hole, and roger had -- this was at, sort of the height of his frus-
tration.  he was saying he didn't understand why chairman wall (danny
wall, chairman of the fhl bank board) was not forthcoming about the true
size of the problem.  and roger felt sure that chairman wall knew about
this and was just ignoring it.  and chairman seidman said, 'well, i know
why he's not doing that' and roger said 'why?'  and seidman said 'well
it's because george gould told him to lie about the numbers.'  now to be
honest, i don't know if lie is the exact word he used, but lie,
misstate, something along that line -- and roger was quite stunned by
that.... and when roger said, 'oh, is that true?, what makes you say
that?,' chairman seidman said 'because he told me to do the same
thing'."

when martin was asked if ms. paylan's account of seidman's comments was
accurate he replied "that's exactly what he said.  " seidman later said
he didn't remember any conversation like that.

(george gould was the deputy under-secretary for finance, working
under treasury secretary jim baker, and the administration's political
point man on the s&l crisis.)

jim barth, danny wall's chief economist at the bank board, was asked how
much money could have been saved if the s&l problem had been addressed
honestly and frankly before the 1988 election, with all the s&ls shut
down and the issue tidied up.  barth said $250 billion.

instead, the total cost of the s&l scandal is now expected to skyrocket
to more than $700 billion.  as william seidman said "well, this is the
mother of all government mistakes.  it is absolutely the largest single
mistake that you can identify the government has ever made in terms
of financial costs.  it is colossal."

meanwhile george bush was elected the 41st president of the united
states on nov.8th,1988.

associate producers were diana hembree, juan a. avila hernandez, and
william kistner; dan noyes, project director; sharon tiller, executive
producer for cir; david fanning, executive producer for frontline.

comments:  sharon tiller, executive producer for cir, provided the
following comments.  first, the press failed to cover the issue during
the critical 1988 election year; not a single question about the s&l
crisis was asked during the three national political debates in 1988.
"the major media also failed to follow up on why the costs of the
bailout kept escalating and whether politics had played a part in the
1988 executive actions on the bailout.''

"the horrendous increase in the cost of the s&l bailout will cost every
citizen in the u.s. thousands of dollars and will substantially weaken
the u.s. economy for decades to come.  because incumbent politicians in
the executive branch and on both sides of the congressional aisle have
found no political advantage in addressing the bailout issue, rectify-
ing the bailout is dependent upon public understanding and pressure.
the general public needs to be aware of how the political system has
failed to resolve the bailout, partially because both political
parties were so compromised by the savings and loan issue.  the voting
public needs to understand this complex issue so they can vote and ask
questions on it intelligently in the 1992 elections, and avoid another
cover-up.

"originally, cir approached the wall street journal to do a companion
story on the bailout documentary, which they initially agreed to do.
they eventually declined to run the report because they couldn't devote
the time and resources necessary to advance the story."  nonetheless,
"the great american bailout" aired to great reviews but little press
coverage.  attempts to do follow-up spinoff print stories in rolling
stone, parade, and the wall street journal all failed from lack of
interest or the publication's failure to advance the story.  cir was
"able to publish one related story in the sacramento bee and the
american banker and several papers picked up the allegations of a
political cover-up in 1988.  no other media outlet has made a major
effort to advance the story about what happened in 1988, to our
knowledge.  "

operation censored war

a secretive administration, aided and abetted by a press more interested
in cheer leading than in journalism, persuaded the american people to
support the gulf war by media manipulation, censorship, and
intimidation.  following are just some of the items the american public
had a right to know about the censored gulf war:

* $ 1.9 billion in u.s.-guaranteed loans to iraq is lost and must be
repaid by american taxpayers.

* u.s. tanks, artillery, and other weapons destroyed more than 30
american tanks, bradley fighting vehicles, and armored personnel
carriers.

* "friendly fire" claimed the lives of 35 servicemen and injured another
72.  the original figures were 11 deaths and 15 injuries.

* pentagon planners have outlined a key u.s. military role in the
restoration of kuwait that may impose martial law for up to one year
and makes no mention of democracy.

* since september 1975, the u.s. ignored all signs of iraqi nuclear
development, including warnings from our own inspectors.

* u.s. tanks, equipped with plows, buried thousands of iraqi soldiers
alive in 70 miles of iraqi trenches.

* u.s.  marines used napalm bombs on iraqi ground troops.

* of the 88,500 tons of bombs dropped on iraq and occupied kuwait,70%
missed their targets.

* the fuel-air bomb -- which kills by sucking every particle of oxygen
from the air with firebombs -- was "experimented" with in the persian
gulf.  this weapon has been compared to nuclear weapons because of its
massive destructive power and inhumanity.

* u.s. television networks refused to run available footage of the mass
destruction from the "turkey shoot" on the road to basra.  they also
refused to broadcast uncensored footage taken deep inside iraq at the
height of the u.s.-led allied air war, documenting substantial civilian
casualties.

* reporters in the gulf were routinely and openly censored and harassed
by public affairs officers, including threats of pulling visas, being
turned over to saudi soldiers, and being held at gun point by u.s.
soldiers.  news copy and film were also routinely "lost" or misplaced
until it was outdated.

* many battlefield casualties were disguised as "training accidents."  a
dover air force base mortuary secretary estimated "about 200"
battlefield casualties.  this account came from a freelance reporter who
posed as a mortician to gain access to the dover afb mortuary, the only
one handling desert storm casualties.

comments:  debra gersh, washington editor of editor & publisher, who
reported extensively on the media coverage of the gulf war for the
national newspaper trade magazine, said "the public has to understand
that it only saw what it was allowed to see.  the whole picture is
important to understanding an event.  that became clearer, i think,
after the cease fire, when restrictions were lifted and news and photos
about the reality of war came through."

jonathan franklin, who posed as a mortician to get his story, said his
article attempted to expose the systematic censorship throughout
desert storm and desert shield.  "as a dedicated reporter," franklin
admitted, "undercover techniques are not a tactic i employ lightly.
but war censorship demanded to be illuminated by truth:  the ghastly
moment of death captured in the face of the dead and dying.  my story
left only a small dent in the armor hiding the truth, but it was a dent
in the foundation of lies, exaggerations and myths which keep this
billion dollar a day dinosaur stuffed with money."

author sam smith said that the public needs to know that in exercises
like the gulf war there is no free lunch.  "they also needed the courage
to express their own doubts," he added.  "but without the knowledge to
express their doubts, they were helpless and went along with the crowd.
" commenting on the media's role as cheerleaders, smith noted "i think
it was a civil war general who told his troops, 'don't cheer boys.  the
poor devils are dying.'  if the media can't ask the right questions at a
time like this, the least it can do is not to cheer, which -- for the
most part -- is what it did during those tragic months."

the bush family and its conflicts of interest

richard nixon had his brother donald; jimmy carter had his brother
billy; ronald reagan had his brother neil.  but, in recent presi-
dential history, no president has had the blatant familial conflicts of
interest that george bush has.

prescott bush, brother

munenobu shoji, president of a japanese real estate firm, reported that
his firm and another, both run by a former japanese crime boss, paid
prescott $200,000 for investment advice.  shoji said he was introduced
to prescott by the president of a firm with connections to an organized-
crime syndicate.  "i thought of making investments in the united
states with the help of mr. bush, who is a financial consultant and
knows many influential people such as the presidents of south korea
and the philippines,'' shoji said.

neil bush, son

neil was a director of silverado savings and loan, in colorado, which
was shut down by regulators in december 1988 and is expected to cost
taxpayers about $1 billion.  regulators were told to delay closing
silverado until after election day in 1988.  in mid-july, 1991, neil was
hired as director of new business development for transmedia com-
munications, a cable sports network.  when asked, bill daniels, the
cable tv tycoon who hired neil, said he will "absolutely" continue to
communicate with the president (george bush) in his battle to stave
off reregulation of the cable industry.

jeb bush, son

jeb bush, a miami real estate developer, knew leonel martinez, a miami
builder, as a generous contributor to bush family causes.  others knew
that martinez imported more than 3 l/2 tons of cocaine and more than 75
tons of marijuana into the united states and was under investigation
for more than four murders.  martinez, also a dedicated reaganite and
active supporter of the contras, is now serving 23 years in prison for
drug trafficking.

george w. bush, son

when harken energy corp. of grand prairie, texas, signed an
oil-production sharing agreement with bahrain, a tiny island off the
coast of saudi arabia, industry experts marveled over how a virtually
anonymous company, with no previous international drilling experience,
could land such a potentially valuable concession.  perhaps the experts
were not aware that george w. bush, eldest son of the president, was on
harken's board of directors and a $50,000-a-year "consultant" to the
company's chief executive officer.  george sold more than 200,000
shares of harken stock just weeks before iraq's invasion of kuwait, on
august 2, 1990 but did not report the "insider" stock sale until march
of 1991, nearly eight months after the federal deadline for disclosing
such transactions.

comments:  author jefferson morley said that "the revelation that the
president and his son and the nation's top drug policy official have
received money from a convicted cocaine trafficker -- and have not
returned said campaign contributions -- is worthy of mass media and
reportorial follow-up.  my article in spin received neither.''

journalist david armstrong notes that "given george w. bush's in-
volvement in harken energy, exposure of the company's more unsavory
connections would be unlikely to improve the president's standing in the
polls.''

the various sources used by project censored to compile this nomination
about president george bush, his family, and their questionable
conflicts of interest combine to make a point about the media cover-
age.  indeed, if a person happened to read a variety of sources on this
issue, one would have a fairly good insight into how members of the bush
family use the presidency to further their personal goals despite the
appearance of serious conflicts of interest.  this is asking a lot of
even the most concerned "good citizen.''  it is the media's
responsibility to collect all the information about the various
intrigues of the bush family and present it to the american public in
the context of the political/economic scene.  this, of course, the media
has not done.

no evidence of iraqi threat to saudi arabia

on september 11,1990, president george bush rallied a surprised nation
to support a war in the persian gulf with reports of a massive iraqi
army which had poured into kuwait and moved south to threaten saudi
arabia.  at the time, the department of defense (dod) estimated there
were as many as 250,000 iraqi troops and 1,500 tanks in kuwait.

on january 6,1991, jean heller, a journalist with the st.  petersburg
(fla.)  times, reported that satellite photos of kuwait did not support
bush' s claim of an imminent iraqi invasion.  in fact, the photos showed
no sign of a massive iraqi troop buildup in kuwait.

journalist heller told in these times, which reprinted her article, "the
troops that were said to be massing on the saudi border and that
constituted the possible threat to saudi arabia that justified the u.s.
sending of troops do not show up in these photographs.  and when the
department of defense was asked to provide evidence that would contra-
dict our satellite evidence, it refused to do it.'  '

the pictures, taken by a soviet satellite on september 11 and 13, were
acquired by the st.  petersburg times in december.  the times contacted
two satellite image specialists to analyze the photos:  peter
zimmerman, a nuclear physicist who now is a professor of engineering at
george washington university in washington, d.c.; and a former image
specialist for the defense intelligence agency (dia) who asked to remain
anonymous.

the specialists saw extensive u.s. occupation at the dhahran airport in
saudi arabia, but few iraqi troops or weapons in kuwait.  they said the
roads showed no evidence of a massive tank invasion, there were no tent
cities or troop concentrations, and the main kuwaiti air base appeared
deserted.

both analysts agreed there were several possible explanations for their
inability to spot iraqi forces:  the troops could have been well camou-
flaged, or they could have been widely dispersed, or the soviets
deliberately or accidentally produced a photo taken before the iraqi
invasion.  but the latter explanation was not considered likely and,
given the reported massive deployment, the specialists found it "really
hard to believe" they could miss them even if they were well camouflaged
and/or widely dispersed.

when asked by the times for evidence to support the official u.s.
estimate of the iraqi buildup, the defense department said "we have
given conservative estimates of iraqi numbers based on various intelli-
gence resources, and those are the numbers we stand by."
while the st.  petersburg times submitted heller's story to both the
associated press and the scripps- howard news service, neither wire
service carried the story.

author:jean heller

comments:  st.  petersburg times journalist jean heller said that while
the story appeared on page one of the st.  petersburg times, and was
made available to the associated press, the scripps-howard wire service
and cnn, none chose to use it.  " ... it failed to get any national
attention at all until after the persian gulf war ended, and it was
picked up and reprinted in an alternative newspaper in chicago (in
these times), she said.  "the main-line media still have not picked up
on the story, despite the fact that the pentagon now admits that the
number of iraqis in and around kuwait was overestimated by american
military intelligence."

heller added that while the story should have received wider coverage
before the war began, and lives were lost, the public deserves to know
the truth about the iraqi threat even now.  "some data, newly released,
indicates that the administration, knowingly or through misreading
of intelligence data, way over-estimated the number of iraqis and their
state of readiness in and around, kuwait.  if that's true, the public
still deserves to know."

heller says she discussed the issue on about two dozen live radio talk
shows from coast to coast during the war and has been interviewed by the
publisher of harper's magazine.  (john r. macarthur, publisher of
harper's, is author of the "second front:  censorship and propaganda in
the gulf war."  )

she adds that macarthur cited the story as one of the only efforts by
any national media to break through the government's wall of
disinformation and packaged information and get at the truth.

heller concludes that "the (st.  petersburg) times itself could not have
done any more to get the story out there.  the paper paid a great deal
of money to get the photos, spent a great deal of time and effort to
reproduce them, and played the story at the top of page one.  but
nobody wanted to listen."

who will unwrap the october surprise?

on april 15,1991, gary sick, a former carter administration staffer
and now professor at columbia university, gave added credibility to
the "october surprise" theory with a 2,000-word op-ed piece in the new
york times.  the "october surprise" thesis suggests that 1980
reagan/bush campaign officials cut a deal with iranian revolutionaries
to delay the release of the 52 hostages until after reagan's
inauguration.

for two and a half weeks, president bush didn't respond to the charges
and the white house press corps didn't ask him about them.  the first
official administration response came in the form of a marlin fitzwater
one-liner:  he called sick "the kitty kelley of foreign policy.  "

the day sick's piece appeared in the times, listing dates and partici-
pants in suspected meetings between campaign staffers and iranian
clerics, none of the network evening newscasts even mentioned the
story.  the new york times ran a page 10 story the day of sick's op-ed
piece but didn't return to the issue until two weeks later, with another
page 10 piece.  the first report in the washington post, a
five-paragraph reuters story, ran eleven days after sick's op-ed piece.
and over the next three months, time and newsweek dealt with the october
surprise one time each:  newsweek in a page 28 story in the april 29
issue, time on pages 24 and 25 of the july 1 issue.

between mid-april, when sick's piece appeared and early august, when
speaker of the house thomas foley announced his decision to move ahead
with a full-scale inquiry, there were a number of newsworthy
developments that were reported by the wire services and picked up by
alternative papers but missed altogether by the major media.  when the
story does appear, the key questions not only go unanswered, they go
unasked.  and this is a story that could make the watergate scandal look
like a third-rate burglary.

finally, back to fitzwater's kitty kelley analogy.  when kelley's book
was released on april 8, all three network evening newscasts ran a re-
porter story.  the local news shows and tabloids went wild.  both time
and newsweek ran kitty kelley cover stories.  and the new york times
scooped everyone with a sunday front-page article outlining kelley's
assertions about nancy reagan's fabricated childhood and her private
lunches with frank sinatra.  and there were follow-up stories and
analysis-of-the-kitty- kelley-hype stories.

within days every marginally conscious american knew about kitty kelley
and her charges about nancy reagan; but even now, few know about gary
sick and the essence of his allegations about the republican campaign
in 1980.

comments:  the "october surprise" story originally was one of the top 25
censored stories of 1987.  based on articles in l.a.  weekly and the
nation, the story revealed reports that reagan's campaign staff had
conspired with iranians to delay the release of the 52 hostages until
after the election.  as noted in the synopsis of julie cohen's story in
the columbia journalism review, the mainstream media didn't pay much
attention to the story until gary sick's op-ed article appeared in the
new york times.  even then, the subsequent coverage was minimal.

cohen noted there had been interesting developments since her article
appeared last september.  last fall, "both houses of congress started,
then cut-off investigations into the october surprise.  some of the go-
ings-on were pretty dramatic (like when senate republicans walked out in
the middle of a public hearing) but you wouldn't have known about it
from the major media.  "

craig mclaughlin, an investigative journalist with the san francisco
bay guardian, cited the journalists who had kept the "october surprise"
issue alive through the years (bay guardian,8/28/91).

noting the brief flurry of interest by the establishment media after
sick's op-ed article appeared, mclaughlin said that "but by and large,
the scandal has been kept alive through the efforts of a handful of
journalists working for the alternative press" including:  joel
bleifuss, in these times; david corn, washington reporter, the nation;
christopher hitchens, minority report columnist, the nation; doug
ireland, press clips columnist, village voice; curtis lang, dan
bischoff, and other reporters, village voice; frank snepp, former cia
agent turned national security reporter; robert morris, creative
loafing, of atlanta; and martin killian, of der spiegel, and robert
parry, then of newsweek, both of whom worked with gary sick.

mclaughlin also noted two additional sources for those interested in
obtaining more detailed information about the october surprise:

the fund for constitutional government, 121 constitution avenue, ne,
washington, dc,20002 (202/546-3732)

extensive files on the subject available to members ($35 annual
membership fee).

inslaw software theft:  justice dept.  conspiracy?

in an ongoing legal battle the inslaw corp. charges that the u.s.
department of justice robbed it of its computer software program,
conspired to send the company into bankruptcy, and then initiated a
cover-up.

the inslaw software in question, called promis, was a potential gold
mine.  a case-management and criminal-tracking program, the software
can also be used to track complex covert operations.  for this rea-
son, promis had sales appeal to both law-enforcement agencies and the
international intelligence community.  in march 1982 inslaw won a $10
million, three-year contract with the justice department, but justice
reneged, withholding nearly $2 million.  consequently, inslaw sought
refuge in chapter 11 bankruptcy and proceeded to sue justice.

in september 1987, federal bankruptcy judge george bason found that
the justice department used "trickery, fraud and deceit" to take
inslaw's property, and in february 1988, bason awarded inslaw $8
million.  not quite one month later, judge bason was denied reappoint-
ment to the bench.  in the past four years, only four of 136 federal
bankruptcy judges have been denied reappointment.  incredibly, bason
was replaced by s. martin teel, one of the justice department attorneys
who unsuccessfully argued the inslaw case before him.  justice
immediately appealed bason's ruling, but in november 1989 a federal
district court upheld bason's ruling.  nevertheless, last spring the
u.s.  court of appeals set aside that ruling on the grounds that the
bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction.

earlier this year the case took a new twist.  based on a number of
sources from inside and outside of the justice department, inslaw's
owners went public with allegations that the reagan justice department,
turned the stolen software over to businessman and arms dealer earl
brian, a friend of both edwin meese and reagan, who served in reagan's
cabinet when he was governor of california.  inslaw alleges that its
software was given to brian as a payback for brian's help in arranging
the now infamous "october surprise" deal.  brian is the owner of
infotechnology, inc., which controls the bankrupt financial news
network and united press international--not to mention hadron, inc.,
which coincidentally, failed in its attempt at a hostile take over of
inslaw.  meanwhile, three different sources have stated in sworn
affidavits that earl brian brokered the promis software on a world-wide
basis.  and according to inslaw owner bill hamilton, his software has
been illegally sold to at least 15 different countries.

according to inslaw's attorney, former attorney general elliot
richardson, "evidence to support the more serious accusations came from
30 people, including justice department sources.  " additionally, the
files of the justice department's chief litigating attorney on the case
have disappeared.

comments:  investigative journalist joel bleifuss said that although the
inslaw case has received national coverage after his in these times
article, the "coverage has been woefully inadequate.  the media has
largely ignored the inslaw allegations involving the october surprise,
robert gates, the disappearance of justice department files, the stone-
walling by former attorney general thornburgh, the connivance of earl
brian, and the apparent rigging of the judicial process."

bleifuss feels the public would benefit from a fuller investigation of
the inslaw case because "it raises important questions about the integ-
rity of the judicial process and -- if the allegations concerning
inslaw's connection to the october surprise hold true -- the sanctity of
our electoral system."

bleifuss also has some chilling thoughts about the consequences of the
limited coverage given the issue.  "first, the mass media's refusal to
put its vast resources to use investigating the inslaw case, sends the
message that such allegations have no merit.  this serves to
delegitimize the work of reporters in the alternative press.  second,
the mass media's failure to take seriously what in this case is a
well-documented example of official malfeasance, sends a message to
mainstream journalists that they will not advance their careers by
investigating government misdeeds.  consequently such investigations
do not take place and elected officials are, by implication, free to
commit such crimes with impunity."

(on january 13,1992, in a little publicized ruling, the u.s.  supreme
court refused to reinstate a $7.8 million judgment won earlier by inslaw
in its long-running dispute with the justice department.)

cbs, nbc spiked footage of iraq bombing carnage

cbs and nbc refused to broadcast rare, uncensored footage taken deep
inside iraq at the height of the u.s.-led air war.  the footage,
initially commissioned by nbc with two producers whose earlier work
had earned the network seven emmys, substantially contradicted u.s.
administration claims that civilian damage from the american-led bombing
campaign was light.

the exclusive videotape, shot by producers jon alpert and maryanne
deleo, during a trip to iraq in early february, portrayed heavy civilian
carnage as a result of allied bombing.

"i thought it was substantial," said nbc nightly news executive producer
steven friedman, who initially approved the material for the
broadcast.  "it was stuff on the ground that nobody else had.  it was
very interesting material that we wanted to use for the show, but the
boss (nbc president michael gartner) said no."  after a meeting with
friedman, anchor tom brokaw, and tom capra, executive producer of the
today show, producer jon alpert said "everybody felt the film was very
good.  friedman is a very competitive newsman and wanted to get the
story on.  they asked for three minutes, to be shown on the nightly news
and the today show, and we reached a financial agreement.''

but despite the enthusiasm shown by friedman and brokaw, who reportedly
fought hard for its airing, gartner killed the footage.

the producers then took the video to cbs, where they got the go-ahead
from cbs evening news executive producer tom bettag.  "he told me,
'you'll appear on the show with dan (rather) tomorrow night," ' alpert
said.  but while he was editing the piece for cbs, alpert got a call
from the network:  bettag had been fired in the middle of the night, and
his piece had been killed.

both networks have stated publicly that spiking the story had noth-
ing to do with the controversial nature of the material.

nevertheless, a series of interviews with network producers who
requested anonymity, charged that the overwhelming support for the ad-
ministration's war effort placed intense pressure on news executives
to toe the line.  "the pressure behind the scenes at the height of the
hostilities to put out a pro-war, pro-administration message was
immense," said a producer with more than 15 years' experience at the
three networks.

the media-watchdog group fairness and accuracy in reporting (fair)
concluded:  "there is a strong indication that intimidation and cen-
sorship has taken place in at least six of the cases that have been
reported to us of stories and broadcasts that were unfavorable to the
administration's war policy.  " several journalists and broadcasters
have claimed to have had their work pulled or even to have lost their
jobs for stories or comments that have been deemed out of sync with
public opinion polls, according to fair.

comments:  this story provides a "smoking gun" example of media
self-censorship which some critics of project censored often demand.
here is a case where two professional television documentary producers
were able to capture dramatic coverage of what happened in iraq as a
result of the heavy u.s.- led bombing campaign.  this was coverage which
had not been censored or edited by the military.  yet, while
journalists at both cbs and nbc news departments were interested in
the footage, both networks decided not to run it.

dennis bernstein, one of the authors of the article revealing the
networks' censorship, said that it did not receive the media coverage it
deserved and that the public would have benefitted from wider exposure of
this story had it been put into the context of the timing of the war.

bernstein added that he originally distributed the article through the
pacific news service, where he is an associate editor, but that none of
the news service's major media clients gave it a second glance.  "the
s.f.  chronicle said it was old news at the time that it broke,"
bernstein noted.

bernstein said that the networks, and their corporate military sponsors
(and in the case of ge and nbc, their owners), were the primary
beneficiaries from the lack of media coverage given this issue.
summing up the media control and manipulation during the gulf war, a
senior network producer with long experience at nbc and cbs said "this
is the most pervasive propaganda control i've ever witnessed.  i've
never seen anything like it."

ironically, while cbs and nbc deprived the nation of information it
should have received during the war, the producers did sell a copy of
their video to japanese television.  and a videotape is now available in
the u.s. to those who want to see what was censored by the networks.  a
28- minute version of the material, titled "nowhere to hide,'' is being
circulated by media watchdog and community groups.

operation ill wind -- dod's untold story

in late 1990,common cause magazine published an explosive article
examining the scandal-plagued history of the northrop corporation, one
of the nation's major defense contractors.  it documented how northrop's
former ceo, thomas v. jones, kept the company thriving despite scandals
involving overseas payoffs, illegal watergate contributions, and falsi-
fied tests on u.s. jet parts used in the persian gulf war.

at the time of the article, up to seven grand juries were reportedly
investigating allegations that northrop engaged in bribery, deliberate
overcharging and falsifying test results.  northrop's record led critics
to depict it as one of the nation's most lawless military contractors.

but northrop was not alone nor necessarily atypical in its operation as
the nation discovered in 1988 when the justice department started a
massive investigation into possible fraud and bribery in securing
defense contracts.  the role of ex-department of defense workers who
were paid by weapons contractors for the exclusive use of their
knowledge was a major national story.  it was called "operation ill
wind'' and it was expected to blow the lid off one of the nation's
biggest scandals.

but it didn't and we'll probably never know why.  after a lengthy
investigation, investigative journalist philip dunn concluded that
"operation ill wind, the 1988 justice department investigation of
possible fraud and bribery in securing defense contracts, will be hidden
forever."

with just one exception, the search warrants and affidavits that contain
transcripts of wiretapped conversations of employees at mcdonnell
douglas, one of the key players in the investigation, were sealed by
court order.  despite the best efforts of the st.  louis postdispatch
to obtain the affidavits, including an appeal to the u.s.  supreme
court, the transcripts will remain sealed.

the post's attorney, jim shoemake, said "search warrants always
historically have been a public record.  they should be open as a public
check on what the government is doing."

edward h. kohn, assistant city editor of the st.  louis post-dispatch at
the time, explained why the paper made such a strong effort to secure
the hidden documents:  "i ... believe that 'operation ill wind' is of
extraordinary scope and importance ... and ultimately may equal or
exceed the 'teapot dome' scandal or the publication of the 'pentagon
papers' in its significance in this nation's history."

comments:  author john hanrahan, who investigated the northrop scandal,
charged that northrop's two decades of corruption -- and the general
topic of ongoing scandal over defense fraud -- continued to get short
shrift in major news media during the last year.  "i know of no expose
of northrop or corrupt defense firms generally in the major news media
- -- certainly not network tv or the news weeklies -- in 1991," hanrahan
said.  "with press focus on the gulf war last year -- and how weapons
made by defense firms were instrumental in the u.s. victory -- the media
seemed unwilling to dampen the nation's perceived 'feel-good' mood
brought on by the war.  ' '

he said that the public would benefit from wider exposure of the dod
fraud issue because it would be in a better position to demand answers
of the president and congress as to why defense contracting fraud is so
widespread; why major offenders get off with such light punishments (and
continue to receive major contracts); and how the system can be
improved to prevent the collusion that often exists between the
government watchdogs and the contractors.  hanrahan noted that "the
president and many members of congress also benefit from the lack of
exposure of defense contracting problems because the current system of
'pork-barrel' politics and campaign contributions from defense
contractor pacs are important to reelection efforts.  "

investigative journalist philip dunn, who explored the justice
department investigation of fraud at mcdonnell douglas, ruefully re-
ported that while the issue didn't receive sufficient media attention,
"in this particular case, the issue is largely over; the st.  louis
postdispatch took on the federal government and the government won.
it's over.  "

"the issue of sealed documents in general hasn't received enough
attention," he added.  "we're dealing with state and federal government
documents, which are by definition (theoretically, at least) part of the
public domain.  if government's purpose is to serve its citizens, to be
'of the people, by the people and for the people,' why shouldn't every
action that the government undertakes be open to public debate?"

foia is an oxymoron

in theory at least, the 25 year old freedom of information act (foia)
bucks the bureaucratic impulse for secrecy.  in reality, however, the
executive branch and federal courts are stretching the law's
exemptions to give that impulse freer rein.  as a result, this precious
piece of legislation is fading into obsolescence.

paul mcmasters, a usa today editor who heads a committee on freedom of
information for the society of professional journalists, sees this bleak
future if the law isn't fixed:  "more adverse court decisions, more
erosion of access rights, more ignoring of foia."

the erosion of foia over the past ten years coincides with a new and
particularly hostile attitude towards the public's right to know which
was ushered in with the reagan-bush administration.  the new administra-
tion expansively redefined "national security" to cover virtually all
aspects of international activity.  a 1982 executive order told govern-
ment officials to classify documents whenever in doubt, and even
reclassified material already released under foia.  the new strategy
became:  fight every possible case, even if the only defense against
disclosure was a technicality.

justice department official mary lawton, addressing an foia conference
sponsored by the american bar association summed up the reagan- bush
approach:  "some of us who have been plagued by this act for 25 years
aren't real enthusiastic about this anniversary.''

foia is supposed to work this way:  you make your request and the
government has 10 days to fill the request or explain why it won't do
so.  but in most agencies roadblocks are endemic.  so are delays,
despite the 10-day deadline.  the fda often takes two years to fill
requests, the state department often takes a year.  last year the fbi
calculated that its average response time was more than 300 days.  a
navy foia officer suggested to one reporter that he'd be better off
finding someone to leak the document he wanted.  "if you have to make a
request," one media lawyer says, "that means you've failed.  "

a major source of the problem lies with the office of management and
budget for insuring that foia offices remain under-funded and under-
staffed.  the navy's central foia office has a staff of two and no fax
machine.  emil moschella, then foia director for the fbi, testified last
year that his 1991 request for new staff was cut in half by justice and
then "zeroed out" by omb.

to make matters worse the d.c.  circuit court of appeals, which handles
most foia cases, and the supreme court have moved aggressively to
expand the government's power to withhold.  one would think that the
press would find such a vital access issue to be of importance, yet
finding significant coverage is as difficult as obtaining it through a
foia request.

tltle:  "the fight to know"

authors:peter montgomery and peter overby

comments:  the authors note that freedom of information is a subject
that journalists talk a lot about -- among themselves.  "the discussions
typically focus on individual cases and immediate problems.  we found
very little written about the issue in general-circulation publications;
for example, they barely glanced at the nasa cover-up attempt described
in our lead.  but while reporters were griping to each other, the reagan
and bush administrations not only expanded but institutionalized loop-
holes in the freedom of information act.  common cause magazine, a fre-
quent foia user, decided it was time to try bringing the subject into
public debate."

the benefit of more public discussion of the threat to foia boils down
to two basic truths according to the authors.  "first, democracy depends
on citizens' access to government information.  second, given the
choice, governments will always operate in secrecy.  if the public, and
the press as its representative, don't continually demand access,
information will be available only to the government and its friends.
as events from watergate to iran-contra show, the nation suffers when
that happens.  if citizens have a better understanding of foia's
importance, they may more actively defend it.  exposure of foia abuses
may encourage efforts to strengthen the law or to hold accountable
those who flout it."

on the other hand, the authors add, "a lack of coverage makes life
easier for any government officials who prefer less oversight to more.
it allows enemies of free access to information to continue to
undermine the public's right to know.  it also serves many in the media
who don't want to make waves.  using foia is never quick, often provokes
a battle and usually produces stories that upset lots of people -- e.g.,
the realization that the challenger explosion was an avoidable
catastrophe.  the 1980s saw a strong and continuing shift away from that
style of investigative journalism."

although the article was circulated to newspapers around the country,
just one reprinted it while several others wrote editorials based on it.
while there has been some action in the senate, senator pat leahy
(d-vt.) introduced foia reform bills, and in the courts, the authors
report that there has been no reversal of the trend they reported.

corporate america's anti-environmental campaign

it would seem that in these times of heightened environmental
consciousness, companies with questionable environmental track
records would be concerned with epa regulations.  but it appears the
corporate sector is paying less attention to non-threatening
government regulators and instead adopting an array of tactics and at-
tack strategies aimed at environmental and citizen groups.

some of the more recent anti-environmental innovations include
multi-million dollar slapp suits, the harassment and surveillance
(including electronic) of activists, the infiltration of
environmental groups by "agent provocateurs," and the creation of
dummy ecology groups to ferret out whistleblowers.  another disturbing
trend is the proliferation of groups such as "the oregon committee for
recycling," an industry front group whose purpose was to lobby against a
recycling initiative on the state ballot.  or "californians for food
safety," which was created by the western agricultural chemical
association, producers of pesticides, who successfully opposed the
state's big green proposition in 1990.

perhaps the greatest coup was pulled off by arkansas' vertac inc., a
superfund polluter, whose "jacksonville people with pride cleanup
coalition" successfully applied for epa money--until they were exposed
by suspicious environmentalists.

this new corporate mind-set may be best exemplified, however, by a copy
of a "crisis management plan" commissioned by the clorox corp., which
was recently leaked to greenpeace.  the plan was prepared by ketchum
communications, one of the nation's largest advertising and public
relations firms.  while greenpeace has an international program aimed
at abolishing the use of chlorine in the pulp and paper industry, they
have not called for a ban on domestic use of bleach.  however, the
ketchum plan was apparently prompted by fears that greenpeace would
eventually target household use of bleach and call for its elimination.

part of the ketchum strategy to counteract the chlorine industry's poor
reputation was to outline "worst case scenarios."  among its many
strategies, ketchum suggests ways to discredit the findings of studies
linking chlorine use to cancer, should the findings ever become
public.  the firm also recommends that clorox "cast doubts on the
methodology and findings," of potentially damaging scientific reports
which haven't even been written yet.

ketchum also recommends labeling greenpeace as violent self-serving
"eco-terrorists;" attempting to sue newspaper columnists who advocate
the use of non-toxic bleaches and cleaners for the home; "immu-
nizing" government officials; dispatching "independent" scientists on
media tours; and recruiting "scientific ambassadors" to tout the
clorox cause and call for further study.

comments:  investigative journalist eve pell noted that while business
efforts to comply with environmental regulations and to market
"green" products have received a lot of coverage, "no one in the major
mass media, to our knowledge, has reported that, nationwide, american
corporations are retaliating against the environmental movement with a
wide assortment of dirty tricks.  not only was there inadequate cover-
age in the mainstream press, there was no coverage of this topic at
all."

wider coverage of this issue would let consumers and voters know that
some of the businesses that purport to protect ancient forests and
furry animals are engaged in efforts to mislead the public and undermine
the work of environmental activists, pell added.  "they would understand
why corporate environmental image-building campaigns -- like chevron's
'people do' series about the oil company's alleged construction of
dens for kit foxes -- are all too often deceptive and fraudulent.  as
informed citizens, they would more accurately evaluate issues that
come before them, which could include whether to buy or to boycott
certain products, to vote for or against legislative proposals and
candidates, or to support environmental organizations."

"perhaps most important," pell noted, "the public would be less easily
taken in by industry efforts to mislead.  they might view with more
skepticism such groups as the deceptively named oregon committee for
recycling, an industry front group that actually opposed a recycling
initiative in that state."

pell suggests that the corporations and industries that buy the good
opinion of the american public with image-building advertising are the
ones that benefit most from the limited coverage given this issue.
"if lawmakers, regulators and consumers do not know that certain
companies are out to undermine the work of environmental groups, those
companies may appear to be good corporate citizens and therefore less
likely to be questioned or criticized.  "

pell concludes that the national news media have not dealt adequately
with the extent and depth of the corporate anti-environmental cam-
paign.

fincen:  a potential threat to privacy & property

a new treasury department agency has been set up by the bush adminis-
tration to strengthen law enforcement through cross-referencing and
analysis of financial, commercial, law enforcement and intelligence
databases.  the new agency is named financial crime enforcement network
or fincen .

fincen did its part for the recent persian gulf war effort, according to
money laundering alert (mla), a financial law enforcement newsletter
published out of miami, florida.

fincen did this by assisting another treasury agency, the office of
foreign asset control, in their white house-assigned task of "be-
ginning the process of identifying iraqi assets in the u.s."  fincen
provided information that "led ofac to freeze 11 bank accounts and
assets in california, georgia, and new york, as well as corporate assets
and a $3.5 million real estate parcel.  "

mla continued, "the properties belonged to people suspected (emphasis
added) of being fronts for saddam hussein...  ". some critics consider
such seizure of property to be a denial of due process, a sixth
amendment right.

fincen obtained the information through what mla refers to as fincen's
"three major databases.  " the first is of "financial information and
intelligence such as that contained in the federal cash reporting
forms 4789 and 8300.  " the second contains "commercial data, such as
corporate and property ownership records from state sources."  the third
holds "law enforcement case files and intelligence from the various
federal agencies."  the political newsletter washington report, contends
that fincen can "invade over 100 u.s. and private financial databases,
irs and dea records, customs reports, land and real estate data.  (and)
census records.  "

fincen was established in 1990 with $13.4 million in funding.  the
agency has apparently blossomed since the naming of brian m. bruh, a
former deputy assistant commissioner of criminal investigation at the
irs and chief investigator for the tower commission, as director in
march 1990.  at that time, mla reported that fincen employed 65 people,
half "detailed" by the irs and the customs service.  it was anticipated
that "a total staff complement of 200" would include "repre-
sentatives" from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, an firearms, the secret
service, the postal inspectors, the dea, unspecified "help" from the
defense intelligence agency and a "liaison" with the cia.
the potential impact on the fourth amendment rights of law-abiding
citizens by a new federal agency created specifically to compile
comprehensive asset holdings data on anyone suspected of wrongdoing
should be explored by the national press.

comments:  project censored first read about the obscure financial
crimes enforcement network (fincen) in an editorial in a small publi-
cation titled washington report.  washington report is a four-page
monthly newsletter published by editors release service in st.  peters-
burg, florida.  the editor, william a. leavell, warned his readers "have
you ever heard of 'fincen?'  no?  you are not supposed to know about
'fincen.'  why?  because what it does is reported to violate the u.s.
constitution's 4th amendment guarantee of your right to privacy.  "
leavell told project censored that he was tipped to fincen by a good
source in the intelligence community he has known for many years.

project censored researchers discovered that fincen, a treasury
department agency, was established, with little fanfare or media
interest, in 1990 and already had played a role in the gulf war effort.
the problem is that fincen potentially threatens the fourth amendment
rights of lawabiding citizens since it is authorized to compile
extensive financial data on anyone who is suspected of wrongdoing.

leavell, a staunch supporter of the bill of rights and a virulent
opponent of censorship, believes "the fincen" operation is a violation
of existing law and the constitution "and a serious invasion of privacy.
he added that information about fincen was made available to the major
electronic and print media but that they "elected to ignore it."
leavell warned that "censorship serves those in power and those who
benefit from the existing political and financial 'establishment'."

who's overseeing congressional oversight?

oversight is one of congress's chief responsibilities, along with
writing laws, raising revenue and spending public money.  so why is it
that on the whole, congress is failing that responsibility, allowing
waste, fraud and abuse to go unchecked throughout the federal
bureaucracy?  a national academy of public administration report once
charged it's because "congressional oversight in general is more geared
to garnering media attention" than making government work better.
according to current and former congressional investigators, the
oversight process today is in a shambles; many investigations are
superficial and scattershot at best.  too many lawmakers are am-
bivalent about oversight and subject to pressure from the targets of
their investigations.  sources within federal agencies have withered;
many whistleblowers, no longer nurtured by congress, remain silent.

no better (or worse) example can be found than the government op-
erations committee -- designed to be the house of representatives' most
tenacious government watchdog.  the committee has floundered since rep.
john conyers (d-mich.) replaced the tough rep.  jack brooks (d-texas),
who had chaired the committee for 13 years.  "we have 360-degree
authority to pursue waste, fraud and abuse," says committee member
christopher shays (r-conn.), "we should strike fear in the hearts of
bureaucrats and contractors.  but nobody's afraid.  "

sources on and off conyers' committee say the chairman, who has
solicited and received contributions from a number of parties with a
stake in his committee's investigations, isn't aggressive or focused
enough.  the 14-term lawmaker, in one insider's words, tends to
"accommodate the people being investigated rather than the
investigators."  in fact, conyers' accommodating nature cost 15-year
congressional investigator tom trimboli his job -- for doing his job too
well.  this is the same man who played a key role in un-covering the
wedtech scandal.  the same man conyers called "as good as they get' --
six months before dismissing him.

the dismissal was the result of a committee investigation, led by
trimboli, of the unisys corporation,, major defense contractor.
trimboli was looking into charges that unisys was defrauding the
government in a $ i .7 billion computer contract they had won with the
air force.  it took only one unhappy phone call to rep.  conyers from
unisys chair michael blumenthal before trimboli was fired, paralyzing
the unisys investigation.  to this date, no hearings have been held
and no final committee report has been issued

the sad state of congressional oversight is best summarized by 30- year
veteran investigator don gray, who recently left the hill.  according to
gray, seldom heard are the sweetest words a lawmaker can say to an
investigator:  "take it where it goes.  i'll back you up all the way."

author:jeffrey denny

comments:  jeffrey denny, senior editor at common cause, charges that
"the problem addressed in 'see no evil' -- waste, fraud and abuse runs
largely unchecked through the federal government because congress's
oversight function has been undermined by lawmakers' close rel-
ationship with special interests and federal agencies -- by its very
nature receives insufficient exposure in the mass media.  "the mass
media by and large views congress's oversight committees as friendly
sources, ignoring the confluence of pressures -- i.e. lawmakers' need to
raise campaign money from special interests and win favors for
constituents from bureaucrats -- that undermine tough, effective
enforcement.  "too often the mainstream media has been used by
publicity-seeking members of congress whose 'investigations' are little
more than quick-hit press events.  when oversight efforts are reported,
key questions remain unasked:  was the committee lobbied by the target
to ease up and what was the impact of the lobbying effort?  did the
target provide campaign-contributions to members of the committee?
did the committee use all its powers to compel testimony and documents
from the executive branch?  were findings used to achieve action, such
as justice department prosecution?

"in three recent cases, the mass media missed a key angle in its
coverage of the hud, s&l and iran-contra scandals:  where was congress,
with all its oversight powers, while these scandals brewed?"

denny says that more information about the failure of congressional
oversight could "provoke congress to make institutional -- and
attitudinal -- changes that will improve its ability to cover waste,
fraud and abuse -- perhaps improving public trust in government and
saving taxpayers money.''  as it is, denny adds "ultimately, special
interests that are ripping off government stand to benefit from the
lack of coverage of congress's lax oversight.  so long as congress
feels it can spoon-feed the press investigatory pabulum and fool the
public into believing it really is doing something about waste, fraud
and abuse, there will be no incentive for lawmakers to change."  he con-
cludes that the mass media no longer can think of congress as a friendly
source, but "rather must hold it accountable as an elected branch of
government with a serious job to do.  "

the specter of environmental racism

no one segment of society should have a monopoly on clean air, clean
water, or a clean workplace; nor should any one segment be targeted for
society' s wastes.  nevertheless, some individuals, neighborhoods, and
communities are forced to bear the brunt of the nation's pollution
problem.  people of color are disproportionately affected by
industrial toxins, dirty air and drinking water, and the location of
municipal landfills, incinerators, and hazardous waste treatment,
storage, and disposal facilities.

this form of "environmental racism" is due primarily to exclusionary
zoning laws, discriminatory land-use practices, industrial facility
siting that targets racial and ethnic minority communities, and the
unequal enforcement of environmental regulations.

according to the workbook (fall 1991):

* 60 percent of the total black population and 60 percent of the total
hispanic population live in communities with one or more uncontrolled
toxic waste sites.

* about half of all asian/pacific islanders and native americans live in
communities with uncontrolled toxic waste sites.

* three of the five largest commercial hazardous waste landfills,
which account for 40 percent of the nation's total estimated landfill
capacity, are located in predominantly black or hispanic communi-
ties.

* lead poisoning endangers the health of nearly 8 million inner-city
children, mostly black and hispanics.

* reproductive cancer among navajo teenagers is 17 times the national
average.

* in 1988, of the 1 i major national environmental organizations, only
six minority persons were found serving on the boards, and only 222
(16.8%) minorities were employed of a total of 1,317 staff members; only
24 percent of those were professionals.

the waste management and hazardous chemical industries have targeted
minorities as the least likely to resist their efforts to locate facili-
ties nobody else wants.  and their callous, self-serving program is
succeeding.

locally nationally, and globally"'

authors:kathy cone newton with frances ortega

comments:  author kathy cone said she doesn't "think 'average'
americans think much about the effects of water and air pollution on
minorities or have thought about the fact that the distribution of
polluting industries and hazardous wastes can be a racial question at
all.  of course, the people who are directly affected, who live with it
every day and suffer the health effects or just plain grimness of
living with it, as evidenced by so many articles in the grass-roots
press, know they are victims of prejudice, whether racial or economic.
as a group, surely they would benefit from more attention in the mass
media because their plight would be recognized and a 'face' would be put
on their dilemma.  and with greater media exposure, americans who
aren't suffering from environmental pollution because they're able to
live as far from the sources as possible would gradually become unable
to deny that to live with clean air and clean water, in a healthy
environment, is fast becoming a privilege and not a right.  a lot of
people think that those who live near the chemical plants or dumps or
toxic waste storage tanks do it either by choice or indifference -- and
they are simply unaware that industry actually deliberately targets
groups of people who are the least likely to resist facilities in their
neighborhoods or to insist on stringent regulations.  without public
awareness of the practice it will surely continue without broad public
resistance."

further, cone suggests that the polluters "won't have to reduce their
production of hazardous materials and wastes as long as the only people
making the fuss are those without political power or economic indepen-
dence and the rest of us can go on believing it really isn't that bad. l
think it's tremendously important for the issue to be given steady
attention by the alternative press, but as long as it stays there, there
won't be enough public pressure to insist on everyone's right to clean
air and water."

cone's hope is that "more articles and news coverage will focus on the
health risks and reduction in quality of life for people who live in
polluted surroundings and to expose the predominance of polluted
environments in places where america's poor and minority people live.
what exists now in the public mind is that we have to live with the
pollution -- or somebody does -- in order to keep jobs and provide
economic growth.  industry, as long as it escapes scrutiny by the mass
media, will be able to keep on promoting this either-or notion of jobs
vs. clean environment."

bohemian grove:  the story people magazine censored

the bohemian grove encampment, which draws the cream of america's male
power elite, including media moguls, to northern california each
year, is one of the media' s best known, best kept secrets.  dirk
mathison, san francisco bureau chief for people magazine, managed to
surreptitiously infiltrate the encampment in search of a story few
reporters have access to.  and he got it.  he recorded a variety of
newsworthy items, including a speech, "smart weapons," by former navy
secretary john lehman, who said that the pentagon estimated that
200,000 iraqis were killed by the u.s. and its allies during the gulf
war.  other speakers included defense secretary richard cheney on "major
defense problems of the 21st century," former hew secretary joseph cali-
fano on "america's health revolution -- who lives, who dies, who
pays,' ' and former attorney general elliot richardson on "defining the
new world order.  "

mathison's entree into the secret world of the grove ended july 20 when
he was recognized by a participant in the activities -- an executive
from time warner -- people's corporate boss.  more loyal to the grove
than to the public's right to know, the time executive escorted mathison
to the gate.  however, mathison already had plenty of material for the
article which was scheduled for aug. 5, 1991.  but suddenly the story
was killed.  landon jones, people's managing editor, said the decision
to kill the story had nothing to do with time warner.  he said it was
killed because mathison hadn't been in the grove long enough to get a
complete story and because the story had been obtained through
questionable means, trespassing.

like mathison, there have been few journalists who have infiltrated the
grove and been allowed to report the story.  one exception is philip
weiss, whose story appeared in the nov.1989 issue of spy.  more typical
are "censored" experiences, such as in 1982 when npr got a recording of
henry kissinger's speech at the grove but declined to air it and, also
in 1982, when a time reporter went undercover as a waiter in the grove
but whose story, also was killed.

time warner's executives are not the only media moguls who patronize the
grove.  others include franklin murphy, former ceo of the times mirror
corporation; william randolph hearst, jr.; jack howard and charles
scripps of the scrippshoward newspaper chain; tom johnson, president
of cnn and former publisher of the l.a.  times.  when associated press
president louis boccardi once spoke at the grove about kidnapped
reporter terry anderson, he referred to his audience as men of "power
and rank" and "gave them more details than he said he was willing to
give his readers."

media apologists who reject the concept of news media self-censorship
often cry "where's the smoking gun?"  here's a smoking gun.

the grove and people magazine subsequently spiked his expose.

i called mathison at the san francisco bureau of people magazine but
while he confirmed what moore had told me he was not willing to go be-
yond what was already known.  he finally said he would have "no comment"
until he heard from his bosses in new york as to what he could say.  as
noted earlier, i also talked to mathison's boss, lanny jones, managing
editor of people magazine.  jones denied any censorship, saying they
couldn't use the story because it had been obtained through illegal
means -- trespassing.

since moore already had contacted the local media about the story, i
told her i'd try to get some national coverage.  "expose," the
short-lived nbc news magazine program, was hot at the time and tom
brokaw had previously expressed interest in project censored's efforts,
so i called him.  brokaw was out of the country at the time and the
person i talked with said she'd get back to me but didn't.  however,
marty lee, at extra!, was very interested in the story and it became the
cover story for extra!  's november/december issue.

jeff cohen, executive director of fair, said this was a "clear cut
example of how an aggressive reporter was not allowed to tell what he
learned through his aggressive reporting because his corporate
managers were more concerned with the sanctity of corporate and
government elites than in journalism."

" in years of exposing incidents of censorship, " cohen concluded, "
this one was one of the most compelling we've come across.  when a
journalist trying to cover how governing elites operate is prevented from
reporting his story because his corporate managers identify with those
elites, it speaks volumes."

meaningless congressional oversight law approved

last year's controversial intelligence reauthorization bill, spawned
in the wake of the iran-contra fiasco, has returned in an updated
version that has once again swept through congress amid minimal fanfare
from the national press.  after a year of backroom negotiations between
the administration and the congressional intelligence committees, both
houses of congress passed h.r. 1455 on july 3 l . president bush signed
the new bill on august 16.

the intelligence bill is essentially the same as last year's proposal,
which was pocket vetoed by the president over provisions which he felt
encroached on his executive authority.  the new bill, while not giving
the president exactly what he wants, is vague enough to satisfy both his
desire for flexibility and congress's desire for statutory covert
action oversight authority.

one key provision from last year's version, which the president objected
to, was a requirement that the president authorize all covert actions
in advance with a written ''finding.''  under the old bill, this
provision has two exceptions.  first, in an emergency situation, the
president has 48 hours after the fact to draft a written finding.
second, while the finding would usually be provided to both the house
and senate intelligence committees, in extraordinary cases the president
may limit notification to congressional leaders.

the president's first objection was to have to notify congress when
soliciting third-party nations or individuals to take part in covert
operations which he felt would seriously hamper foreign policy efforts.
the new law will only require the white house to notify congress if a
third-party will participate "in any significant way" in a covert action
and even then their identity may remain confidential.

the second objection dealt with the wording on how fast the president
should notify congress after issuing a "finding" authorizing a covert
action.  the original bill required the president to inform congress "in
a timely fashion,' ' which lawmakers sought to define as "within a few
days."  committee members now concede that the president may interpret the
phrase as he sees fit.

president bush made no secret of his intentions to utilize this loophole
at will.  upon signing the legislation he stated that sometimes
disclosure "could significantly impair foreign relations, the national
security, the deliberative process of the executive, or the performance
of the executive's constitutional duties."

critics say that these loopholes are large enough to render the new
oversight law, and congress' enforcement role, meaningless.

comments:  author pamela fessler felt the issue received minimal
coverage with little if any network television or news weekly
coverage.  "considering the fact that the legislation was the main
legislative by-product of the iran-contra scandal, it's surprising it
didn't receive more attention," fessler said.  "the bill completely
changed the requirements the administration must meet in reporting
covert actions to congress -- presumably allowing for greater oversight.
"

in general, fessler believes the public would benefit by being made more
aware of what congress does and how the legislative system works.  "they
most often are exposed to scandals and pay raises now," she continued.
"people have a very distorted picture of congress and government in
general, leading, i think to a lack of participation in the political
process.  "

if any interests were served by the lack of coverage given the intelli-
gence oversight legislation, fessler believes it might have been the
media themselves.  "let's face it," she concluded, "some of this stuff
is boring and hard to cover.  it's much easier to cover a congressional
pay raise debate or a fight over taxes "

                            the information monopoly

          the rapidly increasing centralization of media ownership raises
     critical questions about the public's access to a diversity of
     opinion. further, and perhaps not surprisingly, the impact of this
     monopolization of information on a free society continues to be
     ignored by the mass media.
          in 1982, when media expert ben bagdikian completed research for
     his book, the media monopoly, he found that 50 corporations controlled
     half or more of the media business. by december of 1986, when he
     finished a revision for a second edition, the 50 had shrunk to 29.
     about half a year later, when he wrote an article for extra, the
     number was down to 26.
          he also warned that a number of serious wall street analysts of
     the media are predicting that by the 1990s a half dozen giant firms
     will control most of our media.
          bagdikian notes that of the 1700 daily papers, 98 percent are
     local monopolies and fewer than 15 corporations control most of the
     country's circulation. a handful of firms have most of the magazine
     business, with time, inc. alone accounting for about 40 percent of
     that industry's revenues.  the three networks, capital cities/abc,
     cbs, and nbc, still have majority access to the television audience,
     and most of the book business is controlled by fewer than a dozen
     companies, with major categories like paperback and trade books
     dominated by still fewer firms.
          even worse, this situation is exacerbated by the conflict of
     interest inherent in interlocking boards of directors.  a earlier
     study, by peter dreier and steven weinberg, found interlocking
     directorates in major newspaper chains like gannett which shared
     directors with merrill lynch, standard oil of ohio, 20th century fox,
     kerr-mcgee, mcdonnell douglas aircraft, mcgraw-hill, eastern airlines,
     phillips petroleum, kellog company, and the new york telephone co.
          the most influential newspaper in america, the new york times,
     was interlocked with merck, morgan guaranty trust, bristol myers,
     charter oil, johns manville, american express, bethlehem steel, ibm,
     scott paper, sun oil, and first boston corporation.
          time, inc.'s interlocks included mobil oil, at&t, american
     express, firestone tire & rubber company, mellon national corporation,
     atlantic richfield, xerox, general dynamics, and most of the major
     international banks.
          bagdikian's warning is ominous: "... a shrinking number of large
     media corporations now regard monopoly, oligopoly, and historic levels
     of profit as not only normal, but as their earned right.  in the
     process, the usual democratic expectations for the media -- diversity
     of ownership and ideas -- have disappeared as the goal of official
     policy and, worse, as a daily experience of a generation of american
     readers and viewers."
          equally disturbing, the prevailing concern with the bottom line
     coupled with the traditional publishers' tendency to avoid controversy
     fosters wide-spread self-censorship among writers, journalists,
     editors, and news directors.

        the united states of america and its contra-drug connection

     though mounting evidence, with substantive and alarming implications
in terms of u.s. foreign policy and reagan administration propriety,
pointed to a large-scale contra/cia drug smuggling network, the major u.s.
media largely underreported it in 1987.
     testimony by convicted drug smugglers as well as private citizens for
cbs's "west 57th street" program, the christic institute's federal lawsuit
under the rico statutes, and before congressional committees provided a
startling picture of large scale drug trafficking under the auspices of the
u.s. government/contra supply network.
     according to the christic institute (a washington, d.c., based inter-
faith legal foundation), "contra narcotics smuggling stretches from cocaine
plantations in columbia, to dirt airstrips in costa rica, to pseudo-seafood
companies in miami, and finally, to the drug-ridden streets of our
society."  the christic institute's investigation, sanctioned by the u.s.
attorney's office in miami, provided evidence supporting allegations that
1) a major "guns-for-drugs" operation existed between north, central, and
south america that helped finance the contra war; 2) the contra leadership
received direct funding and other support from major narcotics traffickers;
3) some contra leaders were directly involved in drug trafficking; 4) u.s.
government funds for the contras went to known narcotics dealers; and 5)
the cia helped miami-based drug traffickers smuggle their illicit cargo
into the u.s. in exchange for their help in arming the contras.
     revelations of this u.s. contra/drug network first surfaced in 1986
when the christic institute files suit against the u.s. government alleging
complicity in the 1984 la penca bombing in which eight journalists were
killed and dozens of others wounded.  the original lawsuit named 29 men
associated with the contra supply network and alleged to have ties to the
drug trafficking network.  among those charged with complicity in the la
penca bombing were ex-cia and military officers including oliver north,
richard secord, albert hakim, theodore shackley, thomas clines, and rob
owens.
     the christic institute's case cited evidence such as sworn statements
about their missions for the contra resupply network by michael tolliver
and gary betzner, senator john kerry's subcommittee's report, sworn
testimony by reputed ex-cia "asset" and money launderer ramon milian-
rodriguez, and numerous other documents.
     despite the extraordinary allegations and supporting evidence, the
major u.s. media did not commit the resources necessary to explore those
charges and their validity.  in fact, few media even made significant note
of attorney general edwin meese's efforts to stop the miami-based
contra/cia drug connection investigation.
     the u.s. media owe the american public better investigative reporting
so that we can "just say no" not only to drugs, but also to government
complicity, impropriety, and possibly illegality.

         secret documents reveal danger of worldwide nuclear accidents

          on march 11, 1987, nbc broadcast a documentary, "nuclear power:
     in france it works."  it could have passed for a lengthy nuclear power
     commercial. missing from anchorman tom brokaw's introduction was the
     fact that nbc's owner, general electric, is america's second largest
     nuclear power salesman and third largest producer of nuclear weapons
     systems.
          one month after the nbc documentary, there were accidents at two
     french nuclear installations, injuring seven workers. the christian
     science monitor wrote of a "potentially explosive debate" in france,
     with new polls showing a third of the french public opposing nuclear
     power. that story was not reported on nbc news.
          nbc's policy which produced the "nuclear power works" commercial
     and censored the news about two nuclear accidents is typical of the
     international silence about reactor incidents which help explain the
     industry's undeserved reputation for safety.
          the lid to pandora's nuclear safety box was partially opened last
     year when the west german weekly der spiegel published 48 of over 250
     secret nuclear reactor accdient reports compiled by the international
     atomic energy agency (iaea). the report of previously secret iaea
     documents was translated into english for the first time and published
     in david brower's earth island journal.
          some of the "incidents" you never heard about: february 1983 --
     bulgaria's kozluduj nuclear power plant lost pressure in the primary
     cooling system; june 1983 -- three of four pumps failed in argentina's
     embalse nuclear plant; august 1984 -- the primary cooling system in
     west germany's bruno leuschner plant in greifswald burst; october 1984
     -- engineers at the chooz a reactor on the french-belgian border
     discovered numerous "breaks" and "broken welding seams" on the
     critical control rods of the 17-year-old reactor; 1984 --
     czechoslovakia's jaslovska bohunice reactor spilled radioactive
     coolant into two reactor containment units due to the failure of 72
     defective bolts in the circulation system; january 1985 -- at
     pakistan's kanupp reactor, radioactive heavy water leaked while being
     transferred through a rubber hose; february 1985 -- during a fuel rod
     experiment in east germany's rheinsberg reactor, a measuring device
     stuck into the center of the reactor caused a leak of radioactive
     water; april 1985 -- radioactive water and sludge swamped two rooms of
     an auxiliary building at belgium's tihange reactor; december 1985 --
     emergency power in canada's pickerikng reactor failed in three
     separate units for five days.
          der spiegel said that in several of these previously unreported
     nuclear slip-ups "a meltdown was a real possibility." worse yet for
     americans, der spiegel found that human error "is most advanced in
     north america ... sometimes with hair-raising results." a survey of
     official records since the three mile island reactor meltdown in 1979
     shows there have been more than 23,000 mishaps at u.s. reactors -- and
     the number are increasing. in 1986, there  were more than 3,000
     reported incidents -- up 24 percent over 1984. the chilling
     conclusion: "humanity has been sitting on a powderkeg as a result of
     reliance on the 'peaceful' use of the atom."

       reagan's mania for secrecy: government decisions without democracy

          on december 3, 1986, president ronald reagan signed public law
     99-494 proclaiming 1987 "the year of the reader." the blatant
     hypocrisy of that act was clear throughout 1987 as the reagan
     administration outdid itself in its efforts to control, interpret,
     manipulate, disinform, and censor all forms of information.
          typical of the reagan administration's efforts to control its own
     destiny and the nation's history was the justice department memorandum
     filed in a lawsuit that could enable reagan to control the history of
     his involvement in the iran/contra scandal. the administration is
     seeking to overturn a 1986 federal court ruling which limited nixon's
     right to block the release of his white house papers. the justice
     department memorandum would allow nixon to withdraw any documentation
     he thought should be supressed. in effect, nixon would be in control
     of u.s. history between 1968 and 1974. if nixon wins, it will pave the
     way for reagan to control u.s. history from l980 to 1988.
          while alarming, this is merely the tip of the iceberg when it
     comes to reagan's mania for secrecy. following are just three groups
     that tried to warn us about what was happening; the nation's leading
     press didn't think their stories were that important.
          people for the american way -- a report titled "government
     secrecy: decisions without democracy," published in december 1987,
     provides more than 100 pages of well-documented charges about the
     growing secrecy system and its dangers to american democracy. the
     report "tells the story of the institutionalization of secrecy
     throughout the federal government ... the story of unprecedented
     controls on information, not only on defense and foreign policy issues
     where legitimate secrets do need to be protected but on a host of
     topics vital to our daily lives, from toxic wastes to occupational
     hazards, from new technology to the health of our children."
          the reporters committee for freedom of the press -- in march,
     1987, the reporters committee issued a "fyi media alert" about how the
     reagan administration and its supporters restrict public and media
     access to government information and intrude on editorial freedom.
     the 50-page report, retroactive to march 1981, lists 135 specific
     actions, including threatened prosecution of the press for publishing
     classified information; expulsion of foreign journalists; proposed
     restrictive amendments to the freedom of information act; proposed and
     actual use of lie detectors, and many other cases.
          the american library association -- the ala released its 1987
     updated "less access to less information by and about the u.s.
     government: ix," covering 1987. the chronology, which was started in
     1981, provides a damning indictment of reagan administration efforts
     to "restrict and privatize government information" which has led to
     significantly limited access to public documents and statistics. the
     new 1987 report adds 30 pages and 78 specific items to the case for
     reagan's mania for secrecy.

                       bush's oily role in iran arms deal

          vice president george bush's acknowledged support for the
     ill-fated secret arms shipments to iran has been interpreted as
     evidence of his loyalty to the policies of president reagan.
          now, however, other evidence suggests that bush, far more than
     president reagan, promoted the iran initiative, took part in key
     negotiations, and conferred upon oliver north the secret powers
     necessary to carry it out.
          it also has been charged that bush actively promoted the iran
     arms sales because of an economic motive the president did not share
     -- the desire to stabilize the dropping oil prices in 1986.
          peter dale scott, co-author of the iran contra connection and
     former senior fellow at the international center for development
     policy in washington, suggests that bush's primary concern in early
     1986 was to stabilize falling crude oil prices by promoting a common
     price policy between the united states and the oil producers of the
     persian gulf, including, above all, iran and saudi arabia.
          further, scott says, the interest in higher oil prices was an
     explicit goal in some of oliver north's secret arms negotiations with
     the iranians. the price of oil reflected the concerns of bush, a
     former texas oilman, rather than of reagan, a free market advocate.
         scott traces bush's involvement back to the january 17, 1986,
     meeting of the president's national security advisers at which the
     president signed the controversial finding which authorized the arms
     sales. the meeting was attended only by bush and three other known
     supporters of the arms sales intiative -- chief of  staff donald
     regan, national security adviser john poindexter, and poindexter's
     deputy donald fortier.
          as the iran-contra select committee report points out, secretary
     of state goerge schultz and secretary of defense caspar weinberger
     were deliberately kept in the dark about the trip north took with
     robert mcfarlane to tehran three months later. yet bush not only knew
     of the trip but he helped in scheduling it.  in a little-noticed
     message of aril 4, 1986, pondexter told north that, "if we can manage
     it, the vp would appreciate it if the iran trip did not take place
     until the vp leaves saudi arabia. if that screws up planning too much,
     then he will uderstand that we can't do it." the request was honored;
     the mcfarlane-north trip took place a month after bush returned from
     saudi arabia.
          bush's mission to saudi arabia was to persuade leaders of that
     country to help stabilize oil prices then rapidly falling to under $10
     a barrel. his trip was successful;  saudi arabia king fahd received
     the iranian petroleum minister in the autumn of l986 and the two
     countries agreed to opec arrangements for boosting oil prices to $18 a
     barrel. the $18 price brought economic relief to oil-producing states
     like texas which were the key to bush's political base.
          after the arms sale became public, oil industry sources commented
     that mcfarlane and poindexter understood the connection between a
     strong domestic oil industry and national security better than most
     others in the administration.

       pentagon biowarfare research conducted in university laboratories

          overshadowed by star wars and overlooked by the media, the push
     toward biowarfare has been one of the reagan administration's best
     kept secrets. the research budget for infectious diseases and toxins
     has increased tenfold since fiscal '81 and most of the '86 budget of
     $42 million went to 24 u.s. university campuses where the world's most
     deadly organisms are being cultured in campus labs.
          the amount of military money available for biotechnology research
     is a powerful attraction for scientists whose civilian funding
     resources dried up. scientists formerly working on widespread killers
     like cancer now use their talents developing strains of such rare
     pathogens as anthrax, dengue, rift valley fever, japanes encephalitis,
     tularemia, shigella, botulin, q fever, and mycotoxins.
          many members of the academic community find the trend alarming,
     but when mit's biology department voted to refuse pentagon funds for
     biotech research, the administration forced it to reverse its
     decision. and, in 1987, the university of wisconsin hired philip
     sobocinski, a retired army colonel, to help professors tailor their
     research to attract pentagon-funded biowarfare research to the school.
     richard jannaccio, a former science writer at uw, was dismissed from
     his job on august 25, 1987, the day after the student newspaper, the

     sobicinski's mission at the university.
          since the u.s. is a signatory to the 1972 biological and toxic
     weapons convention which bans "development, production, stockpiling
     and use of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts
     necessary for protective and peaceful research," the university-based
     work is being pursued under the guise of defensive projects aimed at
     developing vaccines and protective gear. scientists who oppose the
     program insist that germ-warfare defense is clearly impractical; every
     person would have to be vaccinated for every known harmful biological
     agent.  since vaccinating the entire population would be virtually
     impossible, the only application of a defensive development is in
     conjunction with offensive use. troops could be effectively vaccinated
     for a single agent prior to launching an attack with that agent.
     colonel david huxsoll, commander of the u.s. army medical research
     institute of infectious diseases admits that offensive research is
     indistinguishable from defensive research even for those doing it.
          each of the sources for this synopsis raised ethical questions
     about the perversion of academia by military money and about the u.s.
     engaging in a biological arms race that could rival the nuclear
     threat, yet none mentioned the safety or the security of the labs
     involved.  the failure to investigate this aspect of the issue is a
     striking omission.  release of pathogens, either by accident or

           biased coverage of the arias peace plan by america's press

          on august 7, 1987, five central american nations -- costa rica,
     el salvador, guatemala, honduras, and nicaragua -- signed a regional
     peace proposal that was authored by costa rican president, oscar
     arias. the proposal, known as the arias plan, set specific guidelines
     and target dates for each nation to comply with in order to stabilize
     central america and bring peace to the region.
          two separate studies monitoring u.s. press coverage of the arias
     peace plan revealed a startling bias in how america's leading
     newspapers covered the region following august 7th.  a national media
     watchdog group, the new york-based fairness and accuracy in reporting
     (fair), concluded that the peace accord set off a u.s. media reaction
     that "showed once again the extent to which white house assumptions
     are shared by the national press corps" and how "reagan's obsession
     with nicaragua has turned into a media obsession."  fair's 90-day
     analysis of the new york times found that the times devoted three
     times as many column inches of news space to nicaragua than it did to
     honduras, guatemala, and el salvador combined.
          the other study, by the media alliance, a san francisco-based
     nonprofit organization of media professionals, monitored stories about
     the peace plan that appeared in seven major dailies -- the n.y. times,
     l.a. times, christian science monitor, san jose mercury news, s.f.
     chronicle, s.f.examiner, and the oakland tribune. the conclusion was
     the same -- most newspapers followed the reagan administration's
     direction as to what deserved coverage in central america. altogether,
     the cmmittee members read, sorted, and analyzed a total of 406
     individual articles and editorials and found:
          1) more than 80% of the articles published during the first six
     weeks after the signing of the plan focused entirely or almost
     entirely on nicaragua -- the reagan administration's demands on
     nicaragua's sandinista government, the prospects for renewed contra
     aid, or the extent to which nicaragua was abiding by the arias plan;
          2) while the seven newspapers published numerous articles
     critical of the sandinistas and their efforts to comply with the plan,
     serious human rights problems and violations of the plan by the
     governments of el salvador, honduras, and guatemala went largely
     unreported;
          3) sources quoted for comments and analysis in the seven papers
     were almost always either administration officials, contra leaders, or
     representatives of other conservative organizations that advocate
     military solutions to the region's political conflicts;
          4) editors at the seven papers, when contacted by the san
     francisco bay guardian for its article, generally acknowledged that
     the national press has allowed the reagan administration to set the
     tone for central american news coverage.
          one result of the biased coverage of central america last year
     was that americans were outraged when the sandinistas shut down the
     cia-subsidized la prensa (now reopened) while they were not even aware
     that 70 journalists had been murdered by death squads in el salvador
     and guatemala during the past decade. and that death squad activities
     have increased in those two nations since august 7th.

                  dumping our toxic wastes on the third world

          exporting hazardous and toxic wastes to third world countries is
     a growth industry. the exported material includes heavy metal residues
     and chemical-contaminated wastes, pharmaceutical refuse, and municipal
     sewage sludge and incinerator ash. the risks involved for countries
     that accept our wastes range from contamination of groundwater and
     crops to birth defects and cancer.
          traditionally, the majority of u.s. toxic waste exports have gone
     to canada where regulations are less stringent than in the u.s. but
     now the most abrupt increase is in shipments to the third world where
     the regulations are either nonexistent or sketchily enforced.
          creating the search for new overseas markets is an explosion in
     the volume of recorded hazardous wastes beng produced in the u.s.
     according to the general accounting office, the amount rose from about
     9 million metric tons in 1970 to at least 247 million in 1984; other
     experts place the current figure close to 400 millon metric tons.
          u.s. officials, aware of the sensitive legal and foreign policy
     questions involved, are reluctant to crack down on illegal dumpers
     and, in fact, the government itself is reponsible for generating a
     significant portion of the hazardous waste exports.  one large illegal
     operation broken up last year received more than half its toxic wastes
     from various branches of the federal government, mainly the military.
          some examples of what is happening as discovered by the authors
     using court records, interviews, and the freedom of information act:
          philadelphia is planning to ship 600,000 tons of ash residue a
     year from its municipal incinerator to panama which plans to use the
     materials as landfill for roadbeds;
          u.s. sludge may end up in the tiny british caribbean colony of
     turks and caicos islands which proposes to use it as fertilizer;
          l.p.t., a company with offices in american samoa and california,
     is seeking approval to build an incinerator in american samoa to burn
     u.s. wastes and export the ash to the philippines where it would be
     used as landfill;
          western pacific waste repositories, based in carson city, nevada,
     is poposing to build a hazardous waste storage and treatment plant on
     erikub atoll, an unhinhabited area of the marshall islands.
          the key u.s. government officials responsible for monitoring
     waste traffic claim they are powerless.  "under the federal system, we
     only have control over what's in the country," says wendy grieder, an
     official in the epa's office of international activities.  "once it
     leaves, we can't do anything about it."
          finally, exported wastes may return to haunt us in a very direct
     way.  "it's possible that we could send sludge to the caribbean and
     they might use it on, say, spinach or other vegetables," warned
     grieder.  and since the food and drug administation checks only a
     small portion of foods and vegetables that come into the u.s.,
     exported hazardous wastes could easily end up on our dinner table.

         torture in el salvador:the censored report from mariona prison

          in late 1986, a 165-page report was smuggled out of the mariona
     men's prison in el salvador. the report was compiled by five
     imprisoned members of the human rights commission of el salvador
     (cdhes). the report documents the "routine" and "systematic" use of at
     least 40 kinds of torture on political prisoners.
          the report made three main points: first, torture is systematic,
     not random; second, the methods of torture are becoming more clever;
     and finally, u.s. servicemen often act as supervisors. what is new to
     torture in el salvador, according to the study, is that the use of
     torture, together with the continued (although diminished) use of
     death-squad kidnappings of the "disappeared," are all a systematic
     part of of the u.s. counterinsurgency program there.
          the marin interfaith task force, from mill valley, california,
     assembled the smuggled report from mariona prison into a document
     titled "torture in el salvador." starting in september, 1986, the task
     force has tried to generate media interest in the story.  suzanne
     bristol of the task force, said the group sent the report to the
     nation's major newspapers, including the new york times, the
     washington post, the boston globe, and the los angeles times, as well
     as to the wire services. by february, 1987, when alexander cockburn
     wrote his article for the nation, upi had run a spanish-language story
     and the report had received coverage on spanish-language radio, in
     mexican periodicals and in europe. follow-up calls to the above papers
     produced nothing, except for two letters in december from art
     seidenbaum of the los angeles times, who first wrote "you send plenty
     of homework," and later wrote "we really have ... no staff for making
     a 1500-word article out of a large series of reports."
          as cockburn noted, it was "during this period, on november 22,
     secretary of state george shultz asked congress to approve nearly $7
     million in police aid for el salvador in 1987, providing the necessary
     certification that the government of el salvador had 'made significant
     progress during the six-month period preceding this determination in
     eliminating any human rights violations, including torture,
     incommunicado detention ...'"
          apparently only one newspaper gave the actual report substantial
     coverage.  the san francisco examiner ran two excellent articles by
     free lance journalist ron ridenhour, who quoted state department
     spokesman james callahan saying that the cdhes, the only salvadoran
     human rights group recognized by the united nations, is a communist
     "front organization." (it was ridenhour's charges that led to the
     revelations about the army's massacre of civilians in my lai.)
          on october 26, 1987, assassins, probably belonging to the
     salvadoran security forces, murdered herbert ernesto anaya, head of
     the salvadoran human rights commission and the last survivor of that
     commission's eight founders.
          anaya also was one of the five original researchers and authors
     of the smuggled report from the mariona men's prison.

               project galileo shuttle to carry lethal plutonium

          despite scientific warnings of a possible disaster, nasa is
     pursuing plans to launch the project galileo shuttle space probe which
     will carry enough plutonium to kill every person on earth.
          theoretically, one pound of polutonium, uniformly distributed,
     has the potential to give everyone on the planet a fatal case of lung
     cancer.  galileo will have 49.25 pounds of plutonium on board, most of
     it plutonium 238, a radioisotope 300 times more radioactive than the
     one used as fuel for atomic bombs.
          critics of the plan, such as dr. john gofman, professor of
     medical physics at the university of california, berkeley, and michio
     kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the city university of new york
     claim that putting galileo's plutonium payload into space is both
     risky and unnecessary.
          the plutonium will be used to fuel "radioisotope thermoelectric
     generators" which keep instrumentation warm.  although nasa and the
     doe say there are no alternatives, professor kaku asserts that the
     latest advances in solar cells make it possible to generate solar
     electricity even as far away as jupiter, galileo's destination.
          nasa downplays the possibility of the release of plutonim in an
     accident, stressing that the substance will be encapsulated in "clads"
     made from iridium alloy in a graphite shell.  the doe contends that
     clads can withstand explosive pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square
     inch.  however, a doe safety analysis report on the galileo mission
     obtained under foia states that from the viewpoint of potential
     nuclear fuel release, the most critical accidents would occur on the
     launch pad.  launch pad accident scenarios, such as "tipovers" and
     "pushovers" are estimated to generate explosive pressures as high as
     19,600 psi.
          once in space, galileo is still potentially danglerous.  since
     the solid-fuel rocket substituted for the highly volatile liquid-fuel
     centaur rocket used in the challenger does not have the power of the
     centaur, nasa devised a plan to use the earth's gravitational pull to
     increase the rocket's momentum sufficiently to reach jupiter.  during
     the "flyby" orbits around the earth, galileo would at times be only
     277 miles overhead.  a 1987 nasa report estimates the chance of
     galileo inadvertently reentering the earth's atmosphere to be less
     than one in a million, and, as such, an accident scenario is deemed
     not credible.
          nasa set the probability figures for the chance of a shuttle
     accident at one in 100,000 for thhe challenger. investigation 
     following the crash put the figure at closer to one in 25.
          while "the lethal shuttle: plutonium payload scheduled" was one
     of the top 10 overlooked stories cited by project censored in 1986,
     the continued failure of the media to draw attention to the potential
     risk of project galileo fully warrants its renomination for 1987.

                    u.s. sends bullets to starving children

          between 1979 and 1985, u.s. military and economic aid to honduras
     jumped from $31 to $282 million yearly. the largest increase was in
     military aid which jumped to 28 times the 1979 level. in exchange,
     honduras agreed to become a base for some 15,000 nicaraguan "contras,"
     to join the u.s. military in joint maneuvers, and to provide
     logistical and intelligence support to the salvadoran military in its
     war against the guerrillas.
          during the same time period, u.s. aid designated for development
     assistance dropped from 80 percent to six percent.
          to make matters even worse, floods washed away 60 percent of the
     corn crop in southern honduras in may 1986.  a severe summer drought
     followed the flood, destroying all that remained of the corn and
     wiping out 60 percent of the area's sorghum.
          bishop raul corriveau, the archbishop of choluteca, said,
     "we've seen scenes of misery like never before. children with swollen
     bellies, old people looking like corpses, women and children begging
     for food, men roaming the streets searching for work."
          due to airstrips and bases built by the u.s. and the presence of
     contras and american troops (80,000 troops in 1987), hondurans living
     in the southern region and along the eastern border have been
     displaced.  the livelihoods of 2,000 honduran coffee growers have been
     destroyed and 16,000 hondurans have been forced to leave their homes.
          orphanages and temporary shelters have been filled with "economic
     orphans" -- children who have been abandoned by parents who can no
     longer afford to raise them ... parents who have seen their coffee
     bean fields turned into battlefields.
          it has been estimated that 70 percent of the children are
     malnourished. among those brought to the capital's hospital for
     treatment, 10 to 15 percent die due to a lack of vitamins.
          dr. juan almendares, a physician conducting research on
     malnutrition at the national university in tegucigalpa, "when the
     government says there is no money available to help the hungry, we
     must remember that honduras receives more than $200 million a year
     from the u.s. government. we hondurans ask why isn't any of this money
     going to help the poor?"
          ann m. kelly, editor of food first news, a quarterly published by
     the institute for food and development policy, wrote the following
     lead to medea benjamin's article about the honduran situation:
          "while working on a new food first book in honduras, medea
     benjamin -- food first's central american analyst -- uncovered a food
     crisis of frightening proportions in the southern part of the country.
     we alerted national media in the united states but the story went

          decline in genetic diversity: global disaster in the making

          diversity in the gene pool is shrinking at an alarming rate and
     could lead to what robert cowen, science editor of the christian
     science monitor, says "could become a mass extinction of earth's plant
     and animal species." species extinction of both plants and animals has
     accelerated rapidly in the 20th century and has reached what many feel
     is a state of crisis. from 1600 to 1900, one species disappeared every
     four years; now perhaps 1,000 species become extinct each year. the
     worldwatch institute pamphlet on conserving the diversity of life,
     published in june 1987, predicts the extinction rate in 20 years will
     reach more than 100 species per day.
          the loss of life forms is more than an aesthetic issue.  the
     rapid extinction of food crop germplasm represents a disaster in the
     making.  unless the trend is slowed, mass famine on a global scale is
     a real possibility.  the international board for plant genetic
     resources has issued warnings that the genetic diversity of many of
     the staple crops that feed the world such as wheat, rice, barley,
     millet, and sorghum is imperiled.  72% of the u.s. potato crop is
     concentrated in four genetic strains.  six varieties account for 71%
     of the corn crop.  of the cataloged vegetables grown in the u.s. in
     1901/02, less than four percent still existed in 1985.
          genetic diversity is a prerequisite for agricultural success.
     genetic uniformity makes crops vulnerable to environmental threats
     such as pests, blight, and drought.  the irish potato famine was the
     result of genetic uniformity. the u.s. lost 75% of its durum wheat
     crop in 1953/54 and 50% of its corn crop in 1970, both due to genetic
     uniformity.
          the dimunition of diversity has led to what some researchers call
     the global "seed wars."  as plant species disappear around the world,
     "access to, control over and preservation of plant genetic resources
     becomes a matter of international concern and conflict." the vast
     majority of the world's genetic resources is concentrated in the third
     world. in order to prevent crop stains from inbreeding, the industrial
     nations resort to "germplasm appropriation," a strategy for collecting
     plant genetic material from third world countries. the fact that the
     "collection" is done without recompense further exacerbates tensions
     between industrial and developing nations.
          the plant variety protection act legislation of 1970, which
     broadened the interpretation of u.s. patent laws to allow corporations
     to patent seed varieties, has accelerated the extinction rate of food
     crop germplasm.  germplasm appropriated from the third world is sold
     back to developing countries in the form of hybridized, patented seed.
     farmers in the world's centers of diversity are planting genetically
     uniform crops more and more frequently, thus causing further loss of
     indigenous seed.  the united nations food and agriculture organization
     estimates that two thirds of all third world crops will be from
     uniform strains by the year 2000.
          the disappearance of genetic diversity either by accident or
     design is a critical issue that has had little media coverage or
     public debate. germplasm has not made headlines.  there are no "save
     the barley" bumperstickers. yet every day, more and more of our
     precious food sources disappear forever.

          on june 27, 1986, the international court of justice, under the
     auspices of the united nations, handed down a decision that found the
     united states in violation of international law.  the decision called
     for the united states to cease its international illegal activities
     against nicaragua. the court's decision, 12-3, held that the u.s.
     support of the contras was illegal. a further decision, 14-1, held
     that u.s. mining of nicaragua's harbors and distribution of a cia

     while oliver north was telling contra stories to congress, and while
     secretary of state george schultz was asking congress for $270 million
     in contra aid, the u.s. media failed to inform the american public
     that the reagan administration's efforts were illegal.
         in fact, the international court of justice decision against the
     u.s. was, for all intents and purposes, a non-event in the u.s. media
     in 1987.
          this non-event status was never more evident that in the media's
     failure to cover the november 12, 1987, u.n. general assembly vote,
     94-2, that called for "full and immediate compliance" with the world
     court's june 1986 decision. in particular, the general assembly called
     on the u.s. to cease funding its military activities against
     nicaragua.
          the question of whether the u.s. government rejects international
     adjudication as having a part in aiding peace, or whether the rule of
     international law is valid, void, or only reserved for minor matters
     was never really explored by the u.s. media in light of the world
     court and general asesembly decisions in the united nations.
          the american public has been kept ignorant of this international
     issue and its implications on u.s. policy toward nicaragua largely
     because of media indifference.

                 the tragedy of grenada since october 25, 1983

          while the media permit ronald reagan to cite grenada as an
     american success story, the people of grenada aren't buying it. the
     following description of what has happened in grenada since the 1983
     u.s. invasion was published last year by the committee for human
     rights in grenada.

     1. removal of price controls on food, cement, housing, and other
     essentials of life.
     2. summary firings of grenadian workers without notice, compensation,
     or legal redress.
     3. unemployment now well over 50%.
     4. internationalist workers who previously provided free health
     services deported.
     5. uncontrolled escalation of land, rent, and all prices.
     6. free medical, dental, optical care, and medicines, formerly
     accessible to all grenadians, now eliminated.
     7. grenadian graduates of cuban and other socialist-nation
     universities not allowed to practice in grenada.
     8. open prostitution since arrival of u.s. troops.
     9. use of cocaine, heroin, and crack since invasion.
    10. national women's organization, national youth organization, and the
     grenada human rights organization eliminated.
    11. former institutions now diminished to point of uselessness include
     independent, progressive union movement; free judiciary; and free and
     independent media.
    12. severe devaluation of grenadian dollar.
    13. grenada, whose economy was praised by the world bank and the imf in
     spring, 1983, had a $168 million debt as of march 28, 1986.

          finally, the committee reported in april, 1987, that the o.e.c.s.
     (organization of eastern caribbean states) occupying troops, trained
     by the u.s. have returned in force to grenada and that they are
     directed by u.s. military officers, usually in civilian dress.
     ominously, the committee adds "their abuses are well known."

          the extent and inflammatory nature of the charges by the
     committee for human rights in grenada surely deserve investigation by
     the u.s. media.

                         americans spying on americans

          the reagan administration's paranoid concern with communism has
     led to the development of a national private spying network and an
     official effort by the fbi to turn america's librarians into spies.
          people and groups who speak out against reagan adminstration
     policies put themselves in jeopardy of surveillance by private
     intelligence-gathering organizations composed of conservative groups
     with close ties to the white house. members say they pass on the
     information they collect to federal agencies, like the justice
     department, and on occasion to the white house itself.
          conservative groups involved in these spying activities include
     the institute for contemporary studies, the young america's
     foundation, the council for inter-american security, and the capital
     research center.
          stephen schwartz works at the institute for contemporary studies,
     a san francisco think-tank founded by top reagan aides like ed meese.
     schwartz calls it "the commie-watching network."
          michael boos, program director of young america's foundation,
     says the group promotes conservative ideas on college campuses .. and
     keeps track of what the left-wing opposition is up to.  boos keeps
     files, makes lists, takes photographs ... all to keep an eye on
     students and professors he says "need watching."  boos says that two
     top-level reagan adminstration officials -- ken cribb, assistant to
     the president for domestic affairs, and frank donatelli, the
     president's chief political advisor -- support his work. both serve on
     young america's board of directors. young america's financial records
     reveal the oganization received money from the federal government --
     over $100,000 from the united states information agency.
          michael waller gathers information on left-wing activists for a
     private political group called the council for inter-american
     security. the council claims that bill casey was driven to have a
     brain seizure because of harassment by the liberal media and liberal
     members of congress. it also claims that michigan congressman george
     crockett was once a communist agent and that other congressmen who
     secretly collaborated with the soviet kgb included john burton, ted
     weiss, ron dellums, john conyers, don edwards, and charles rangle.
          willa johnson, who heads the capital research center which
     gathers information on opponents of white house policies, is former
     deputy director of personnel at the white house. the center gets its
     money from corporations and right-wing benefactors like joe coors and
     ellen garwood, two key funders of the secret white house effort to
     support the contras.
          meanwhile, the fbi officially recruits librarians to spy on
     library users who might be diplomats of hostile powers recruiting
     intelligence agents or gathering information potentially harmful to
     u.s. security. while the current program, euphemistically called the
     "library awareness program," started shortly after the august, 1986,
     arrest of a soviet spy who frequented new york libraries in search of
     student recruits and stolen, unclassified library materials, the fbi
     said the program has existed for years in various incarnations.

             reagan's 1980 "october surprise" -- arms for hostages

          in october 1980, nothing worried the reagan campaign as much as
     the possibility that the 52 hostages held by iran might come home.
     a "paramilitary wing" created by reagan's campaign staff to prevent
     such a possibility was largely unreported in 1987.
          the revelations report that then campaign manager william j.
     casey headed an "october surprise" team engaging the services of both
     retired and active military personnel.
          during the course of the 1980 campaign, campaign leaders richard
     allen, edwin meese, and casey became concerned, almost to the point of
     paranoia (according to journalists jack germond and jules witcover)
     that carter would get the hostages released thereby stealing away
     reagan's election momentum and assuring carter of re-election.
          following is a brief overview of the reported activities of
     reagan's "october 1980 surprise" team:
          various reports reveal that casey's "paramilitary wing"
     monitored u.s. military movements for the reagan campaign, met with
     representatives of the bani-sadr government of iran, and covertly
     obtained president carter's debate briefing materials prior to the
     november election.
          these revelations alone carry enormous constitutional
     implications -- private citizens soliciting military and intelligence
     assistance in monitoring u.s. government operations, private citizens
     meeting with foreign dignitaries in possible state negotiations, and
     private citizens clandestinely obtaining property of the united states
     president -- and yet they were not followed up by the major media once
     discovered and revealed in small, non-mass media publications.
          even more disturbing is the issue of iranian arms shipments.
     documents confirm that within its first month, the reagan
     administration gave a green light to israel to resume its arms
     shipments to the iranian government.
          these revelations support former iranian president bani-sadr's
     assertion that the arms supply contract iran signed with israel in
     march 1981, less than two months after reagan's inauguration, was the
     payoff for delaying the release of the american hostages until after
     the november 4, 1980 election.
          the hostages remained in captivity until january 20, 1981, the
     day reagan took the oath of office, and they left teheran minutes
     after he became president.
          a conspiracy between a presidential candidate and a hostile
     foreign power against an incumbent president would seem to be without
     precedent in american history. at the very least, it would seem that
     the documented charges revealed by a few journalists last year
     deserved to be investigated for the benefit of the american public by
     the u.s. media.

               oliver north's secret plan to declare martial law

          while caught up in exposing fawn hall's hairstyle, ollie north's
     heroic gap-toothed smile, and the soap opera ambience of the
     congressional contragate hearings, most of america's media ignored the
     chilling constitutional issue of oliver north's secret plan to declare
     martial law.
          but alfonso chardy, of the miami herald, was not deluded by
     north's charisma nor frightened by north's earlier warning to him not
     to investigate the national security council's (nsc) connection to the
     nicaraguan resistance.
          unfortunately, chardy's extraordinary disclosures about north
     went unexplored and unreported by other major media.
          on july 5, 1987, chardy reported over the knt news wire that
     marine lt. col. oliver north helped draft a plan in 1984 to impose
     martial law in the united states in event of an emergency.
          according to chardy, the secret plan called for suspension of the
     constitution, turning control of the government over to the
     little-known federal emergency management agency (fema), appointment
     of military commanders to run state and local governments, and the
     declaration of martial law in the event of such a crisis as nuclear
     war, violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition to
     a u.s. military invasion abroad.
          north helped draft the plan to impose martial law while serving
     as the nsc's laiason to fema. chardy reported that an administration
     official said the contingency plan was written as part of an executive
     order or legislative package that reagan would sign and hold within
     nsc until such time as a severe crisis arose. "it is not known whether
     reagan signed the plan," chardy added.
          the plan was extraordinary enough to even frighten then-attorney
     general william french smith into protesting to robert mcfarlane,
     north's nsc boss at the time, that fema was establishing itself as an
     "emergency czar" and "exceeding its proper function as a coordinating
     agency for emergency preparedness."
          this secret plan to declare martial law in the event of internal
     dissent or national opposition to a u.s. military invasion abroad took
     on an added dimension as citizens gathered to protest the nation's
     intervention in honduras in march, 1988.

          tuning out non-ionizing radiation and public health/safety hazards

               growing evidence that long wave non-ionizing radiation used in
          electromagnetic devices, microwave products, and tv/radio systems is
          harmful to the public's health, hazardous to effective public safety
          systems, and threatening to military security went largely unreported
          by america's media in 1987.  also underreported were the related
          issues of the environmental protection agency's shut-down of its
          funded programs to study non-ionizing radiation in light of a 1989
          deadline to establish safety standards for public exposure to radio
          frequencies, and, the lawsuit brought against the reagan
          administration by a coalition of plaintiffs who charge that the
          administration has violated the national enviromental policy act by
          not adequately protecting the public and environment from the "hazard
          of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance" (hero).
               studies that suggest links between electromagetic fields (such as
          those produced by overhead power lines, broadcast towers, military
          hardware, hairdryers, microwave ovens, computers, tv and two-way
          radios, and radar), and cellular mutation, cancer, and childhood
          leukemia have received little attention. university of north carolina
          epidemiologist david savitz confirmed earlier reports about the
          apparent public health hazard.  savitz emphasized the need for further
          research and more federal funding to determine the extent of this
          potential health risk.  fifteen of 17 occupational studies have
          established links between exposure to low frequency electromagnetic
          fields and cancer.  despite this mounting evidence, the epa shut down
          its program to study non-ionizing radiation which is supposed to set
          acceptable levels of exposure for humans and the environment by 1989.
          meanwhile, total federal funding to study the health effects of low
          frequency fields has dropped from $10 million to just $2.5 million.
               a coalition of pentagon watchdog organizations and individuals
          has brought suit against the government charging reagan administration
          officials with willful negligence in protecting the public from the
          hero effect. though the navy and army have been aware, for some 33
          years, of the hazard that electromagnetism poses to weapon systems,
          the pentagon has acknowledged very little about the hazards that
          accidental explosions caused by various electromagnetic sources pose
          to public and environmental safety.  the plaintiffs cite five specific
          hero related accidents, including the 1967 explosion on board the uss
          forrestal which claimed 134 lives, along with a possible 25 other hero
          related accidents that have occurred over the past 25 k;years.
               finally, in a continuing conflict related to the issue of
          electromagnetic radiation and its effects on public safety and health,
          radar specialist veterans have been filing health claims, related to
          their exposrue to low frequency radiation, against the veterans
          administration.  all claims to date have been rejected.
               with such a newsworthy issue as the effects of electromagnetic
          radiation on public health and safety so clearly being played out
          during 1987, the news media, for the most part, failed to tune in.

                 glowing outlook for food irradiation business

          the food industry is going high-tech with a seemingly innocent
     procedure called irradiation -- a process that delays ripening by
     exposing food to radioactive materials that kill insects, mold, and
     bacteria.
          critics point out that irradiation may produce food products that
     at best have lower nutritional value; at worst are carcinogenic.
     irradition also poses significant health threats to workers and the
     public in transportation, storage, and disposal of radioactive waste.
     and there is real concern over the safety of radioactive devices used
     in food, beverage, cosmetic, and drug industries.
          while spices are the first irradiated edibles marketed in the
     u.s., the food and drug admnstration (fda) also has approved
     irradiation for use on produce and some meats. interestingly, the fda
     regulates irradiation not as a process but as an additive.
          the question, of course, is exactly what is "added" to irradiated
     food? irradiated food looks and smells better for an extended time,
     but little is known about the chemical changes induced by the process.
          one science writer posed the complex issues when he asked "what
     do you get when you irradiate an apple with 100,000 rads of gamma
     rays.  is that irradiation a process or an additive?  who should
     control it?  does it pose a carcinogenic threat to humans? since it
     reduces food spoilage and replaces dangerous pesticides, is it a
     blessing for the world's hungry?"  and then he asked, "why are there
     no answers to these questions?"
          meanwhile, the track record in irradiation facilities is anything
     but reassuring.  the radiation technology plant in far rockaway, new
     jersey, was closed by the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) for
     willfully supplying false information about repeated safety
     violations; the nrc also shut down international nutronics in dover,
     new jersey, after workers reported a coverup of a radioative spill of
     a tank of water containing cobalt-60 rods; and workers in isomedix
     co., parsippany, new jersey, were told to clean up leaks by pouring
     radioactive water down bathroom toilets and sinks.
          earlier this year, the nrc suspended the use of an industrial
     air-purifying device that leaked tiny particles of radioactive
     polonium at plants around the nation. the nrc also order 3m to recall
     for inspection all 45,000 of the ionizing air guns used to control
     static electricty and remove dust from product containers. of 828
     plants inspected so far, contamination was found at 118 sites; of
     those, the radiation exceeded the reportable limit of .005 microcuries
     in 39 plants. subsequently, the nrc recalled 2,500 3m units used in
     the food, beverage, costmetic and drug industries.
          given the potential problems, one would expect to find the
     irradiation issue on the national media agenda; but it isn't.
     meanwhile, as serious questions go unanswered, the government has
     proposed federal regulations that would allow more irradiation.

         american tale of two cities: the growth of economic apartheid

          the atlanta chamber of commerce will produce reams of hype about
     the city this summer for the democratic national convention.  in turn,
     the media will dutifully hype the rest of the nation about atlanta.
     but there is another side to atlanta that has gone largely unreported
     by the u.s. media.
          economic forces at work in atlanta are "producing a new kind of
     segregation, which threatens to leave blacks out of the great job
     reshuffling that is taking place not only in the jewel of the south
     but throughout the country."
          in atlanta, corporations are moving their operations and jobs to
     cobb and gwinnett counties, two overwhelmingly white, affluent,
     republican-voting suburbs to the north of atlanta.
          though many media have profiled the metroatlanta economic
     renaissance, specifically highlighting gwinnett county, the fastest
     growing county in the nation, most have failed to state that both cobb
     and gwinnett, though considered part of metroatlanta, do not share the
     tax base or government with the city.
          black citizens of atlanta have no share in the new economic
     affluence profiled by the media.  in fact, with the particulars of
     this metroatlanta economic demography in mind -- no shared tax-base,
     no shared government, no shared public transportation system, new
     freeway project connecting outlying suburbs and bypassing inner city
     access, corporate flight, and the traditional (racist) dividing line
     of interstate 20 -- the proliferation of an economic apartheid is
     easily seen.
          when asked why corporate development went north, j. patrick
     murphy, the senior vice president for economic development of gwinnett
     county's chamber of commerce, pulls out a map and points to interstate
     20, which runs from east to west straight through atlanta, halving the
     metropolitan region.  "since before the time of the civil war, it was
     understood that free blacks weren't to come above this line. and most
     of them still live south of it," says murphy.  "i suppose development
     just follows the money."
          david beers and diana hembree, who exlored this issue with
     support from the fund for investigative journalism, said it "would be
     a mistake to interpret atlanta's racially skewed boom as peculiar to
     the south and growing mainly out of the region's historical
     prejudices. it is probably more accurate to take atlanta as it bills

             omb compiling nation-wide blacklist of grant violators

               the office of management and budget is compiling a master
     computer list of those debarred or suspended from participating in
     government agency grant programs. gary bass, executive director of omb
     watch, a public interest group that monitors the budget office, said
     the goal of reducing waste, fraud and abuse is laudable but warned
     that the program "can become a hit list for individuals and
     organizations that the administration does not agree with."
          the controversial program will cover a wide range of
     transactions, including grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships,
     fellowships, loans and subsidies.  it would apply to both recipients
     of federal funds and those "doing business" with them. the system is
     expected to be fully operational by may, 1988.
          under the new law (reagan's executive order 12549), 20 agencies
     which disburse $100 billion in grants will forward their debarred
     lists to the omb.  the master list will be computerized and placed on
     a nation-wide automated telephone system. regulations published in the
     federal register (5/29/87) say that the master list will contain names
     and "other information" about currently debarred or suspended grant
     recipients, as well as about those whose debarment is pending.
          under the directive, federal, state and local agencies, private
     organizations and individuals handling federal funds must check the
     list before providing anyone a federally-aided service, grant, loan or
     other assistance such as day care.  any person or organization that
     fails to check the list may also be placed on it.  in addition,
     employees of federally-funded agencies and organizations, as well as
     anyone "doing business" with them or wishing to do business with them
     must submit annual certifications that neither they nor anyone
     "associated with" them are on the list, or being considered for it.
          grounds for placement on the list include 1) violating any term
     of a "public agreement," regardless of whether federal funds were
     involved; 2) failure to repay a government-backed or assisted loan,
     such as a home mortgage, student or crop loan; 3) "failure to perform"
     or poor performance on a grant or other "public agreement;" 4) lack of
     "business integrity or honesty" or conviction of "business" crimes; 5)
     debarment or suspension by a public agency at any level of government,
     federal, state, or local.
          one can also make the blacklist if one: is a public school
     teacher and goes on strike despite a no-strike clause in one's
     contract; performs poorly on any grant from a public agency,
     regardless of whether federal funds were involved; does business with
     anyone known to be on omb's new list.
          various agencies already keep records of those who violate rules
     of grants, using the lists to prevent such recipients from getting
     additional grants from the agency involved. but, under current law
     those same recipients may obtain grants from other federal agencies.
          rep. jack brooks (d-tx), chair of the house government operations
     committee warned that the omb's implementing guidelines "endorse guilt
     by association, reverse the presumption that a person is innocent
     until proven guilty, and define the operative offenses so vaguely as
     to potentially encompass many entirely legitimate activities."

                roundup -- the world's most popular weed killer

          eduardo neaves was a healthy and happy twelve-year-old, the son
     of migrant farm workers. but after swimming in a canal in coral
     gables, florida, he became a "total quadriplegic." the canal was
     contaminated with four times the recommended-use level of  roundup, a
     herbicide produced by the monsanto company. toxicologists were not
     surprised by the central nervous system damage that still afflicts the
     boy five years after the incident but were unable to prove a
     connection between roundup and the paralysis in court.
          but whether roundup can cause damage to the central nervous
     system may never be known. although monsanto's original neurotixicity
     studies were ruled invalid by the epa because of "extensive gaps in
     the raw data supporting study findings and conclusions," there is no
     requirement that a new study be made. however, roundup is far more
     dangerous than the public has been led to believe. records of
     pesticide poisoning compiled over the last five years by california's
     department of agriculture show that among some 200 pesticides widely
     used in the state, roundup has been linked to the greatest numbers of
     eye, skin, and internal injuries. the epa's own pesticide incident
     monitoring system (which was dissolved by the reagan administration)
     recorded more than 100 cases of roundup poisoning in 1980. despite its
     own findings, the epa concluded the weed killer is "not a primary skin
     irritant, and is only minimally irritating to the eye." that judgement
     was based solely on data provided by monsanto.
          dr. ruth shearer, a genetic toxicologist, charged that monsanto's
     claims about the safety of the product are dishonest because they are
     based on phony studies on cancer and birth defects performed by the
     now defunct industrial bio-test lab (ibt). once the nation's leading
     generator of health effects studies for companies whose chemical
     products require government approval, ibt was found to have conducted
     shoddy tests and falsified results. monsanto was ibt's biggest
     customer, according to court documents, and was reported to be one of
     four chemical companies that knew of ibt's fraudulent testing
     practices. one ibt executive, paul l. wright, was employed by monsanto
     before and after his tenure at the testing lab.  it was during
     wright's stay at ibt that the lab performed tests involving roundup's
     connection to mutation in mice and tumors in rabbits.  wright was
     convicted of fraudulent testing in 1983. (the ibt story was the top
     "censored" story of 1982.)  despite the known hazards, the danger is
     compounded by the variety of new uses for which the herbicide is being
     promoted. it is applied to citrus and grape groves in california,
     soybeans in the middle west, christmas trees in maine, coffee beans in
     brazil, as well as crops grown for vitamins and spices, house plants,
     and government forests in the pacific northwest.  in fact, roundup
     is the world's  most popular brand-name herbicide.  it is easily
     monsanto's most important product, the first herbicide to reach annual
     sales of $1 billion.  it is marketed in 120 countries and accounts for
     more than half of monsanto's foreign sales.
          given roundup's fraudulent approval; its significant health and
     environmental hazards; and that it is the most widely used brand-name
     herbicide in the world, the issue deserves significant media
     attention. at the very least, monsanto should be required to redo the
     studies that are now known to be invalid.

                  puerto rico: the revolution at our doorstep

          in august, of 1987, the united nations committee on
     decolonization voted to ask the united states to immediately remove
     itself from puerto rico and to recognize the puerto ricans' right to
     self-determination and independence. this was the 11th time the u.n.
     committee made this request. and, each time the request was ignored by
     the united states government and by the u.s. press.
          in 1898, puerto rico won its autonomy from spain and was well on
     its way to becoming an independent nation. that is until july 25,
     1898, when the united states invaded the island. after three years of
     resistance by the puerto rican people, the u.s. military might
     prevailed and puerto rico became a u.s. colony. in 1952, it became a
     "commonwealth," but the colonlial pattern, with 90 percent of the
     country's industry in u.s. hands, continues to this day.
          puerto rico is rife with social and environmental problems, many
     of them stemming from its status as an american colony. one
     independence group claims that "forty percent of puerto rican woman
     have been sterilized as part of a deliberate u.s. strategy to
     depopulate the island."  unemployment drives many puerto ricans to
     seek work in the u.s. many others left their homes in order to
     accommodate the seven military bases there. military recruiters prey
     on desperate youth experiencing 75 percent unemployment. bombing
     practice on the island of vieques destroyed the local fishing industry
     there. and while puerto rico has eight federal "emergency list" toxic
     dump sites, no u.s. environmental laws apply there. the u.s. is in
     violation of the treaty of tlateloco, which prohibits the storage of
     nuclear arms in latin america, by storing nuclear weapons in puerto
     rico.
          unfortunately for puerto rico, its importance to the u.s. is not
     limited to its industrial development but rather to its critical
     position as a u.s. military base. currently 13% of puerto rico is
     controlled by the u.s. military. roosevelt roads, the largest u.s.
     naval base outside the continentnal u.s., is located in puerto rico.
     and, when the u.s. military is forced to leave guantanamo, cuba, and
     panama, in the 1990's, the military importance of puerto rico will
     increase significantly.
          the puerto rican people are resisting by every means they can
     from demonstrations protesting u.s. war games, to protests over plans
     to strip-mine mineral-rich puerto rico, to militant occupations of
     u.s. military controlled-land, to armed actions.
          as a result of the growing independencestruggle, the u.s. has
     intensified its repression.  fbi surveillance, the use of grand juries
     to imprison activists, and a deliberate media portrayal of puerto
     rican independistas as terrorists are all designed to destroy the
     movement for self-determination. it was recently revealed that the
     puerto rican intelligence division, a unit known for its closeness to
     the fbi, maintains a 74,000-person "subversives list" which includes
     not just those affiliated with armed actions but lawyers, writers, and
     others who engage in serious dissent.
          given the ongoing repression and the increasing dissension, it
     may well be that our next vietnam is not nicaragua, but our very own
     "commonwealth" -- puerto rico.

         congressional conflict of interest: company man probes contras

          the integrity of the congressional panel investigating the
     iran-contra scandal was seriously compromised by the appointment of
     thomas polgar as an investigator. the appointment also might explain
     why cia involvement in drug trafficking and the la penca bombing were
     not explored during the televised hearings.
          during the vietnam war, polgar, the cia station chief in saigon,
     was the object of congressional criticism because of his ongoing
     misinformation campaign to defend a continuing u.s. presence in
     vietnam even though his own emergency rooftop departure from the
     embassy was only two months away. despite his history of misleading
     congress, polgar was appointed to the senate panel which raises
     undeniable conflict-of-interest issues.
          polgar is an active mmeber of the association of former
     intelligence officers (afio), an organization that actively lobbies
     congress on behalf of u.s. intelligence activities. he served as a
     consultant to the vice president's task force on combatting terrorism,
     a group loaded with operatives who participated in the covert aid
     pipeline to the contras, including john poindexter and oliver north.
     he is a paid consultant for a corporate risk-analysis firm that had
     ties to ex-nicarguan dictator anastasio somoza. and in vietnam, polgar
     worked for theodore shackley, a former top cia official who
     facilitated arms sales to iran.
          polgar was one of two investigators who traveled to costa rica to
     investigate such things as contra drug running and the la penca
     bombing which was supposed to kill eden pastora, the dissident contra
     leader, but instead killed eight other people including one american
     journalist.
          evidence supporting cia involvement in the la penca bombing and
     drug trafficking was within reach of polgar when he arrived in costa
     rica.  john hull, a u.s. rancher based in costa rica, would have been
     a logical witness to interview because of his ties to the supply
     network and allegations about his involvement in drug running.
     however, hull told in these times that he never talked with polgar.
     polgar also failed to interview peter glibbery, a key witness to
     hull's operation, who is in jail in costa rica.
          polgar did interview two reporters from costa rica's english
     language newspaper, the tico times, but did not seem interested in
     hard facts. "his questions were subjective, what we thought about
     pastora and hull", said reporter beth hawkins. "polgar didn't want to
     hear anything specific -- dates, evidence, sources." nor did he even
     ask about la penca.
          as with watergate, the congressional hearings on the iran-contra
     issue could have helped restore credibility to our government;
     instead, sending a longtime cia operative to investigate a scandal
     replete with cia illegalities only further compromised the integrity
     of the system.

          every once in a while, radical animal rights activists commit an
     act of protest which earns the media attention. but rarely do the
     media publicize the issues which drive the activists to action.
          according to the congressional office of technological
     assessment, 17 to 22 million animals are used yearly for testing in
     research laboratories.  animal rights activists believe the figure is
     closer to 70 million.
          animals have been used to determine what the potential adverse
     effects would be to humans if exposed to explosives, chemicals, binary
     poison gases, radiation, infectious bacterial and viral diseases, and,
     of course, cosmetics.
          dogs, primates, rats, cats, mice, and rabbits are not the only
     animals being cruelly treated in the u.s.  now the mistreatment of
     exotic animals is also being reported.
          because the meat of exotic animals, like deer, elk, and buffalo,
     is leaner than commercial meat and without antibiotics, it has become
     a popular menu item in trendy east coast restaurants.  venison
     consumption jumped from 1,000 pounds a week in 1985 to 4,000 pounds a
     week in 1986 in new york.
          animals reported slaughtered in 1986 in north america included
     9,000 bison, 5,000 caribou, countless thousands of deer, and untold
     numbers of wild boar, elk, llamas, and water buffalo. before these
     animals were killed, many of them lived in stacked cages, barely with
     enough room to turn around in.
          in australia, three to five million kangaroos are killed yearly.
     marian newman of the international wildlife coalition described this
     slaughhter as "one of the most barbaric commercial wildlife massacres
     in the world."  their hides are typically used for athletic shoes,
     dress shoes, purses, belts, cattle whips and novelty items. according
     to dean wilkinson, legislative director for greenpeace, in the u.s.,
     adidas, puma, and florsheim continue to make kangaroo-leather shoes.
          in 1987, the corporate owners of three california bay area pet
     stores agreed to pay a $150,000 settlement rather than risk a higher
     jury verdict for having allegedly sold sick animals, beat some animals
     to death, and practiced veterinarian medicine without a license.
     unfortunately this was not an isolated case. particularly offensive is
     the exotic bird trade which sees between 50,000 and 100,000 birds
     enter the u.s. illegally every year. but perhaps the most offensive
     thing about pet shops is not their greed and cruelty but their
     superfluousness.  with more than 20 million unadopted dogs and cats --
     many of them purebreds -- being put to death every year in the
     nation's tax-supported shelters, why do we need a pet industry?
          a nation of people who sometimes seem to care more for their pets
     than for one another might be tempted to do something about animal
     cruelty if they knew more about it. the issues that force animal
     rights activists to take to the streets surely deserve better coverage
     by our media.

                      project censored 89 - top 10 stories


 the growing threat of a handful of monopolistic global media lords to the
international marketplace of ideas was named the top under-reported issue of
1989 according to a national panel of media experts.

 ben bagdikian, professor at the graduate school of journalism at the
university of california, berkeley, warned that mammoth private organizations,
driven by the profit motive, already dominate the world's mass media and
threaten the freedom of information which is the basis for all liberty.

 the second most under-covered story of the year, cited by project censored,
described how international sludge dealers are turning africa into the world's
toxic waste dump; the third ranked story revealed how u.s. officials are
supporting "one of the most brutal holocausts since world war ii" in
mozambique.

 now in its 14th year, project censored, a national media research effort
conducted annually at sonoma state university, california, locates stories
about significant issues which are not widely publicized by the national news
media.

 following are the top ten under-reported news stories of 1989 as announced by
project director carl jensen, professor of communication studies at sonoma
state university:

 1. global media lords threaten freedom of information. five major media
corporations already dominate the fight for hundreds of millions of minds
throughout the world and they concede that before the turn of the century they
may control most of the world's important newspapers, magazines, books,
broadcast stations, movies, recordings and video cassettes.

 2. turning africa into the world's garbage can. africa, already suffering from
poverty, drought, famine, locusts, "contra" wars, and the aids epidemic,
appears destined to become the world's toxic waste dump as international sludge
dealers try to dump u.s. and european waste onto at least 15 african countries.

 3. the holocaust in mozambique. a u.s. state department official has called
the attacks by the mozambique national resistance (renamo) "one of the most
brutal holocausts against ordinary human beings since world war ii." more than
one million, mostly innocent men, women, and children have already died. renamo
is reported to be funded by south african sources and conservative, right-wing
groups int he united states and europe.

 4. america's deceitful war on drugs. the governmetn's war on drugs is more
hype than reality. one of the nation's top narcotics prosecutors quit in
frustration last year after state department officials interfered in his
investigations of top people in the cocaine business. a senate subcommittee
revealed that foreign policy interests sidetracked, disrupted, and undercut the
"war on drugs."

 5. guatemalan blood on u.s. hands. the bush administration strengthened ties
with the oppressive guatemalan military last year at the same time that human
rights violations by the military rose sharply. one unpublicized violation
occurred last year when a u.s. citizen, sister diana ortiz, working as a
teacher in guatemala, was kidnapped, beaten, tortured, and sexually molested by
three men, one of whom was a uniformed guatemalan police officer. the u.s.
department of state didn't register a protest.

 6. radioactive waste in the neighborhood landfill. radioactive waste may be
joining old tires, banana peels, and other regular garbage at the local
landfill if the nuclear regulatory commission, the environmental protection
agency and the nuclear industry implement their little-known plan to deregulate
radioactive waste to "below regulatory concern."

 7. oliver north & co. banned form costa rica. in 1989, oliver north, former
national security advisor john poindexter, former u.s. ambassador to costa rica
lewis tambs, major general richard secord, and former cia station chief in
costa rica joseph fernandez were barred by president oscar arias from ever
setting foot in costa rica again. a costa rican congressional commission
concluded that the contra re-supply network in costa rica, which north
coordinated from the white house, doubled as a drug smuggling operation.

 8. wall street journal censors story of cbs bias. the wall street journal
censored a major story by one of its top reporters, mary williams walsh, which
exposed how one of the nation's most respected tv news departments, cbs news,
broadcast biased news coverage of the afghanistan war to the american people.

 9. pcbs and toxic waste in your gasoline. the u.s. general accounting office,
the epa, and the fbi are investigating sophisticated "waste laundering" schemes
in which hazardous toxic wastes and solvents, including pcbs, are mixed with
gasoline and diesel and industrial fuel and sold to consumers.

 10. the chicken industry and the national salmonella epidemic. the chicken
industry's drive for profits, aided by relaxed inspection practices by the u.s.
department of agriculture, has led to a national epidemic of 2.5 million cases
of salmonella poisoning a year, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 9,000 deaths.

 the other 15 under-reported stories of 1989 were: how the federal emergency
management agency failed the nation; the secret pan am 103 report the media
ignored; the u.s. is poisoning the rest of the world with banned pesticides;
the u.s. presence is destroying the environment in central america; media
reliance on conservative sources debunk myth of liberal bias; faulty computers
can trigger world war iii; rico and slapp lawsuits endanger free speech rights;
nasa lied to get plutonium payload into space; u.s. congress ignored soviet
plea for nuclear test ban; the oppression of exploitation of native americans;
how the u.s. and the media propagandized the war on drugs; the profitable
revovlving employment door between the environmental protection agency and the
polluters; sellafield: the largest source of radioactive contamination in the
world; the national parks are in serious trouble; the plaintive case for animal
rights.

 the panel of judges who selected the top ten stories were: dr. donna allen,
founding editor of media report to women; jonathan alter, senior writer,
newsweek; ben bagdikian, professor, graduate school of journalism, university
of california, berkeley; jim cameron, founder and systems operator, compuserve
journalism forum; noam chomsky, professor, linguistics and philosophy,
massachusetts institute of technology; george gerbner, professor, annenberg
school of communications, university of pennsylvania; nicholas johnson,
professor, college of law, university of iowa; rhoda h. karpatkin, executive
director, consumer's union; charles l. klotzer, editor and publicsher, st.
louis journalism revew; judith krug, director, office for intellectual freedom,
american library association; frances moore lappe, executive director, food
first; bill moyers, executive editor, public affairs television; jack l.
nelson, professor, graduate school of education, rutgers university; herbert i.
schiller, professor, department of communication, university of california, san
diego; sheila rabb weidenfeld, president, d.c. productions.

 jensen, who created project censored in 1976, said "the impact of global media
lords on the free flow of information is seen in the number of critical issues
which are undercovered or "censored" by the mass media each year. the media's
penchant for self-censorship and desire to avoid sensitive issues, coupled with
the bush administration which is even more secretive than the reagan era,
deprives the public of information about issues it should know about."

top ten censored stories for 1990

project censored, sunday, feb. 24, 1991



rohnert park--the limited media coverage given to the events which led up to
the gulf war was cited as the top under-reported issue of 1990, according to a
national panel of media experts.

... the second most under-reported story of the year focused on the botched
and expensive solution to the savings and loan crisis while the third ranked
story explored the role of the central intelligence agency in the s&l scandal.

now in its 15th year, project censored, a national media research effort
conducted annually by sonoma state university, california, locates stories
about significant issues which are not widely publicized by the national news
media. [founder and director of the project is carl jensen, professor of
communications at the university.]

the "ten best censored news stories of 1990" will be the subject of an
hour-long media documentary hosted by award-winning journalist bill moyers...
[the documentary, "moyers/project censored," was aired on pbs stations on
feb. 25.]

following are the top ten under-reported stories of 1990:

1.   flawed coverage of the gulf crisis. traditional press skepticism was the
first casualty in the days immediately following iraq's invasion of kuwait.
the media, concerned about appearing to be unpatriotic, fell into the unseemly
role of pentagon cheerleaders for the administration. even the defense
department spokesman, pete williams, admitted that "the reporting has been
largely a recitation of what administration people have said."

2.   s&l solution is worse than the crime. the $500 billion, estimated to be
needed to bail out the savings and loan industry, is more than the entire cost
of world war ii, in current dollars and including service-connected veterans'
benefits.  the resolution trust corporation, the federal agency entrusted with
solving the problem, is now accused of producing a massive giveaway that will
make teapot dome look like a demitasse cup.

3.   the c.i.a. role in the s&l crisis. the question of what happened to the
billions of s&l funds is partially answered by an investigative journalist who
found links between s&l's, organized crime figures and c.i.a. operatives,
including some involved in gun running, drug smuggling, money laundering and
covert aid to nicaraguan contras.

4.   nasa shuttle destroys the ozone shield. dr. helen caldicott, world
renowned physician and environmentalist, warns that every time the space
shuttle is launched, 250 tons of hydrochloric acid is released into the air,
contributing to the destruction of the ozone layer.

5.   media blackout of drug war fraud. a top-ranked undercover agent, recently
retired from the drug enforcement administration, reports that the
administration's widely-touted "drug war" is really a "psychological war,
aimed at convincing america through the press that our government is seriously
trying to deal with the drug problem when they're not."

6.   what really happened in panama? new reports from non-mainstream but
authoritative sources reveal that the legal foundations for the panama
invasion, the bush-noriega relationship, the actual american and panamanian
casualty figures and the post-invasion conditions in panama have been
misrepresented to the american people.

7.   the pentagon's secret billion-dollar black budget. an investigation by a
pulitzer-prize-winning investigative journalist exposed the pentagon's secret
"black budget," which was once used to fund america's 11 intelligence
agencies, but is now being used by the administration and the military to
conceal the costs of many of their most expensive and controversial military
weapons.

8.   the bill of rights had a close call. the mass media failed to tell the
public about the potential repressive impact of the gramm-gingrich anti-crime
bill introduced in both the u.s. senate and the house in 1990. the bill called
for "a declaration of national drug and crime emergency," which critics say
would have essentially nullified the bill of rights had it passed through
congress.

9.   where was george? despite repeated assertions by president george bush
that he was "out of the loop," new material from oliver north's diaries,
obtained through a freedom of information lawsuit, provided additional
information that president bush played a major role in the iran-contra scandal
from the beginning.

10.  america's banking crisis. top economists report that the same economic
conditions that led to the demise of the savings and loan industry are now
eating away at our commercial banks and that the same kinds of accounting
gimmicks that hid the s&l crisis are being used to cover up the commercial
banking crisis.

the other 15 under-reported stories of 1990 were: 

 1.  conflict of interest over north's acquittal.
 2.  the chemical industry and its cocaine connection.
 3.  the big banks' role in laundering drug money.
 4.  the u.s. military's toxic legacy to america.
 5.  media's vdt radiation stories that still don't make the news.
 6.  bush-mosbacher-baker and their lucrative leaking oil barge business.
 7.  the america library association's fight against government secrecy.
 8.  the national media ignore c.i.a. misdeeds.
 9.  there was no massacre in tienanmen square.
10.  does the medical establishment suppress alternative cancer treatments?
11.  the united states and our global dumping grounds.
12.  malathion: death from the skies.
13.  the c.i.a., the la penca bombing and a murder indictment.
14.  the return of electroshock: the "new, improved" psychiatric therapy.
15.  the congressional intelligence authorization act that would subvert the
constitution.

emeritus, graduate school of journalism, university of california at berkeley;

sheila rabb weidenfeld, president, d.c. productions.

... prof. carl jensen, who created project censored in 1976, said "this
media research project has been called an `early warning system' for the
nation. the number of military and financial and economic issues that were
under-reported in 1990 surely provided an ominous warning of what the united
states could expect in 1991."

anyone interested in nominating a "censored" story of 1991 can send a copy
of the story to carl jensen, project censored, sonoma state university,
rohnert park, california 94928. deadline for nominations is nov. 1, 1991.

     centrally controlled information has always posed one of the greatest
     threats to liberty and justice for all.  think you're well-informed?
     think we in america have free an unfettered access to *all* the goings
     on around us and throughout the world--particularly those that might 
     have a negative effect on our ourselves or others in far away lands?
     read on to see what the top-ten most censored stories for 1989 were
     as selected by "project censored", an annual nationwide media research
     project, created in 1976 by dr. carl jensen, professor of 
     communications studies at sonoma state university.  quoting from their
     own brochure:

       the primary objective of "project censored" is to explore and 
     publicize the extent of censorship in our society by locating stories
     about significant issues of which the public should be aware, but is
     not, for one reason or another.

       some of the most important news of 1989 scarcely made the headlines.
       from corporate thought control to toxic waste in your gas tank, the
     major news media failed to report numerous big stories--and project
     censored has identified them.  in the united states, says project
     censored's founder, sonoma state university journalism professor carl
     jensen, stories are censored, not by outright government repression,
     but by "the media's penchant for self-censorship and desire to avoid
     sensitive issues, coupled with the bush administration, which is even
     more secretive than the reagan era, [depriving] the public of
     information about issues it should know about."
       for the 14th year a panel of distinguished journalists and
     journalism experts, under the auspices of project censored, has
     selected the top ten censored stories of the year.

       this year the panel's selection for the number one under-reported
     story focuses on the very issue that inspired project censored:  the
     increasing monopoly of a few giant media corporations, which control
     more and more of the world's means of exchanging ideas and
     information.  [the growing threat of a handful of monopolistic global
     media lords to the international marketplace of ideas was named the
     top under-reported issue in the 14th annual media research effort
     title "project censored".  ben bagdikian, professor at the graduate
     school of journalism at the university of california, berkeley, 
     warned that mammoth private organizations, driven by the profit 
     motive, already dominate the world's mass media and threaten the
     freedom of information which is the basis of all liberty.]
       the top ten censored stories of 1989 are:


     1. corporate thought control
        [global media lords threaten freedom of information.]
        [source:  "the nation," 6/12/89, "lords of the global village," by
         ben bagdikian.]

       news media have given us some glimpses of the high-stakes game of
     corporate mergers, but they have been almost silent about the growth
     of the small number of international companies that now dominate their
     own industry.  in an article in "the nation," june 12, 1989, media 
     scholar ben bagdikian describes the power of five international 
     giants, time warner, inc., bertelsmann ag, news corporation ltd. 
     (rupert murdoch), hachette sa and capital cities/abc--together with a 
     second string of huge media organizations like gannett--to control the
     information, ideas and entertainment that shape people's consciousness.
       vertical monopolies multiply media power:  if one firm owns
     magazines, newspapers, movie studios and theaters, tv stations and
     record companies, it can create hits or celebrities that suddenly seem
     to be showing up everywhere.  and media monopolies extend beyond tv and
     movies to the traditionally more sober areas of book publishing and
     even scholarly journals.
       bagdikian warns that the size and global audience of these firms
     give them a stake in reducing communication to all-purpose, acceptable
     content.  book publishers, for example, are steered toward
     "blockbuster" books with huge sales.  controversial publications that
     might not sell in some part of the world market (salmon rushdie's
     "satanic verses," for example) are seen as commercial failures.
       corporate links to the industries that make news--banking, for
     example, or tobacco companies--give these media monopolies incentives
     to stifle dissenting voices.  at the same time, giant media firms have
     make-or-break power over politicians and many of their programs.
       bagdikian warns that, as many countries are moving toward more
     democracy and civil liberties, these international media monopolies
     pose a new threat to freedom of communication.  he proposes an updated
     united nations declaration on freedom of information that would
     establish antitrust principles and assure diversity and access in the
     media, to combat the "new mutation of that familiar scourge of the
     free spirit, centrally controlled information."


     2. dumping on africa
        [turning africa into the world's garbage can.]
        [source:  "in these times," 11/8/89, "western developmental 
         overdose makes africa chemically dependent," by diana johnstone.] 

       as industrialized countries fill up their capacity for disposing of
     toxic waste--or companies get tired of paying high prices for toxic-
     waste disposal in the u.s. and europe--some have searched for
     populations so desperately poor they will accept other countries'
     toxic wastes in exchange for badly needed cash.  they have found some
     takers, not surprisingly, in sub-saharan africa, already suffering
     from poverty, drought and famine.
       in the nov. 8th-14th issue of in these times, diana johnstone 
     describes several instances of toxic-waste dumping on africa, 
     including:  a 1987 deal by the government of guinea-bissau to accept
     toxic waste for $40 a ton;  a private arrangement by an individual in
     nigeria to allow an international toxics-disposal firm to dump pcbs in
     his backyard;  an agreement by the government of benin to take up to
     five million tons a year of toxic waste for money to help pay its $700
     million foreign debt.
       european environmentalists persuaded the european parliament to
     condemn this practice and demand cancellation of toxic-waste contracts
     in may 1989.  the organization of african unity has also condemned it,
     fearing that african governments' need for foreign exchange will push
     them to specialize in toxic-waste disposal, a pattern one congolese
     diplomat called "attempted murder of african people."  but the poverty
     and large expanses of sparsely populated land in many sub-saharan
     countries make regulations against toxic-waste dumping hard to
     enforce.

     |    the federal emergency management agency during the oct. 17th    |
     |    earthquake.  the story traced fema's internal political         |
     |    history, demonstrating that its priority has increasingly       |
     |    been nuclear-war preparedness.  under the leadership of         |
     |    right-wing ideologues assigned to the agency by the reagan      |
     |    administration, planning for nuclear-war survival has so        |
     |    dominated the agency's agenda that it has failed to prepare     |
     |    for or provide help in real-life emergencies.                   |

     3. hidden holocaust
        [the holocaust in mozambique]
        [sources:  "20/20," 3/2/90, "children of terror" and "against all
         odds," by janice tomlin and tom jarriel;  "renamo watch," 2/90,
         "renamo's u.s. support;"  "utne reader," nov/dec 1989, "the hidden
         war in mozambique," by kalamu ya salaam;  "mozambique support 
         newsletter," 2/90.]

       last year, as u.s. news media celebrated the overthrow of repressive
     communist regimes, they all but ignored an ongoing, massive campaign
     of almost unbelievable cruelty being waged against the government and
     people of mozambique by right-wing terrorists--with material and
     political support from private individuals and groups in the united
     states and europe.
       the difference in coverage, observed the november/december 1989
     "utne reader" seems obviously related to the fact that "the
     government of mozambique is predominately black and socialist and its
     chief enemy is the white-ruled anti-communist regime in south africa."
       south africa initially armed and supported the mozambique national
     resistance, whose methods include not only extensive economic sabotage
     like blowing up bridges and burning villages--causing widespread
     famine in this poorest country in the world--but also cruelty aimed at
     terrorizing people.
       its special targets are children, who are forced to watch the
     torture and murder of family members, drafted into the army at ages as
     young as eight, forced to kill other children and villagers, raped and
     mutilated and separated by the tens of thousands from families and
     native villages.  three of every five mozambican children dies before
     age five.
       senator jesse helms, who calls renamo "freedom fighters," television
     evangelist pat robertson and the washington-based heritage foundation
     are among the u.s. citizens giving political or financial support to
     renamo.
       roy stacy, u.s. state department deputy assistant secretary for
     african affairs is quoted in the "utne reader" article calling the
     renamo campaign "one of the most brutal holocausts against ordinary
     human beings since world war ii."  the united nations and the world
     bank have both recently issued reports on the war in mozambique.  but
     a march 2, 1990 report on abc's "20/20" and a few stories on national
     public radio have been almost the only u.s. mainstream press coverage
     of renamo's devastation of mozambique.


     4. losing the drug war
        [america's deceitful war on drugs.]
        [sources:  "nbc nightly news," 2/22/89, by brian ross, ira 
         silverman, and garrick utley;  "san francisco chronicle," 12/89,
         "policy reportedly undercut drug war."]

       does the u.s. really want to win the war on drugs?  that was the
     question the news media should have raised when richard gregorie, one
     of the country's top narcotics prosecutors in miami, quit his job.
     gregorie had aggressively pursued big-time cocaine bosses and drug-
     corrupted officials in and out of the united states.
       but as he began going up the drug-business chain of command, he
     targeted foreign officials friendly with the u.s. government, and the
     state department started interfering with his investigations, telling
     him to stay away from certain sensitive areas.  gregorie's operations
     were subsequently stopped at the request of the state department and
     he quit in protest.
       one story on the feb. 22,1989 "nbc nightly news," by brian ross, ira
     silverman and garrick utley, and a brief "new york times" news story
     in december 1989 reported on gregorie's claims of interference by the
     state department, but in other media the story was suppressed.  an
     editor at the "new york times magazine" assigned a free-lance writer
     to profile gregorie, but a senior editor later killed the article.


     5. history repeats itself
        [guatemalan blood on u.s. hands.]
        [sources:  "guatemala update," 2/90, "us aid said to encourage 
         rights violation;"  "guatemala human rights commission/usa,"
         12/24/90, "u.s. citizen kidnapped and tortured in guatemala."]

       continuing a pattern that the u.s. government seems determined to
     repeat again and again, the bush administration has strengthened ties
     with the guatemalan military at the same time that its human rights
     violations are rising sharply.
       according to a 1989 review by human rights watch, current u.s. army
     involvement in guatemala includes the training of guatemalan
     paratroopers by green berets and $90 million of "nonlethal" military

     6. what radioactivity?
        [radioactive waste in the neighborhood landfill.]
        [source:  "the workbook," apr/jun 1989, "nimby, nukewaste in my
         backyard?" by diana d'arrigo and lynda taylor.]

       faced with the difficulty of disposing of ever-increasing amounts of
     radioactive waste, the nuclear regulatory commission, the
     environmental protection agency and the nuclear industry are
     developing a plan to define away part of the problem.
       they propose to re-label as much as one-third of the material now
     considered "low-level" radioactive waste as "below regulatory concern"
     [brc].  the waste material could then be dumped into ordinary
     landfills or recycled into consumer products.
       this scheme, reported by diane d'arrigo in the april/june 1989 issue
     of "the workbook," a publication of the southwest research and
     information center in albuquerque, would make disposal of the waste
     easier and cheaper, since it would not be subject to the regulations
     and extra fees required for the disposal of radioactive waste.
       but the material would remain radioactive for hundreds of years,
     posing a continuing health threat to any nearby living things--the
     nrc, the article charges, consistently underestimates the health
     threat posed by low-level radioactive material.
       the downgrading of some radioactive materials to "brc" status would
     make it easier to deal with the expected increase in the amount of
     nuclear waste, resulting from the cleanup of contaminated weapons
     plants and the planned "decommissioning" of older nuclear power
     plants.
       the "workbook" cites an nrc advisor, dr. martin steindler, pointing
     out that the greatest danger of reclassification is that brc is
     forever:  if the material is dumped as ordinary, not radioactive,
     waste, there will be no record of where it is.  fires, leaks into
     ground water and other events could increase the health risks posed
     by nuclear wastes buried in some landfill somewhere--but no one
     would know it was there.  the reclassification would also take away
     state and local rights to keep the radioactive waste out of their
     territory.
       the nrc is expected to decide on whether to implement this plan
     sometime in 1990.


     7. ollie north & co.
        [oliver north & co. banned from costa rica.]
        [source:  "extra!," oct/nov 1989, "censored news: oliver north &
         co. banned from costa rica."]

       although the kerry commission's findings on the u.s.-contra drug-
     trafficking link caused little outrage in the u.s. congress, a costa
     rican congressional committee concluded that the contra-resupply
     network, operating in costa rica and coordinated by north from the
     white house, doubled as a drug smuggling operation.  that finding
     prompted oscar arias sanchez to bar north and his gang--poindexter,
     secord, joseph fernandez and former u.s. ambassador to costa rica,
     lewis tambs--from ever again setting foot in costa rica.
       the associated press reported this action in a lengthy press wire
     (7/22/90), but according to "extra" (the fairness and accuracy in
     reporting newsletter), the "new york times" and all three national
     networks--perhaps following congress's example of complacency--failed
     to carry the story.

        [wall street journal censors story of cbs bias.]
        [sources:  "columbia journalism review," jan/feb 1990, "mission
         afghanistan," by mary williams walsh;  "defense media review,"
         3/31/90, "wall street journal and cbs:  case of professional
         courtesy?" by sean naylor;  "the progressive," 5/90, afghanistan:
         holes in the coverage of a holy war," by erwin knoll.]

       mary williams walsh, a respected journalist covering the afghan war
     for the "wall street journal", came face to face with media self-
     censorship when she wrote a story reporting that "cbs news" was
     broadcasting biased coverage of the afghanistan war.  in a well-
     documented article submitted to her editors at the journal, walsh
     presented evidence that the cbs reporter-producer based in peshawar
     was not an objective journalist, but a mujahideen partisan who favored
     one guerrilla commander and in effect "served as his publicist."  she
     also reported that the cbs correspondent tried to set up an arms deal
     between the guerrilla leader and a new jersey arms manufacturer.
       walsh went on to show that the correspondent influenced other
     journalists' reporting of the war by feeding them disinformation.  in
     a may l990 interview with "the progressive", walsh tells of secret
     meetings between editors at the "wall street journal" and, walsh
     believes, communications with "cbs news" which finally led to the
     journal's decision to kill the story and her own decision to resign
     from the paper.  the "columbia journalism review" offered to publish
     her story and walsh accepted.  but the article that finally appeared,
     according to walsh, changed the central point of her story:  "that
     'cbs news'...failed to provide truthful and comprehensive coverage of
     the afghan war."


     9. toxics in your tank
        [pcbs and toxic waste in your gasoline.]
        [source:  "common cause magazine," jul/aug 1989, "toxic fuel," by
         andrew porterfield.]

       it costs a lot--as much as $1,000 a drum--to get rid of toxic waste
     like pcbs and solvents legally.  so someone could make some money by
     taking these toxics off the hands of companies that need to get rid of
     them and hiding them someplace they weren't supposed to be--like your
     gas tank.
       in the july/august issue of "common cause" magazine, andrew
     porterfield revealed the otherwise unreported story that federal
     investigators had found an oil transport company in buffalo, n.y.
     operating just such a scheme.  among other, similar cases, they found
     at least five million gallons of hazardous waste solvents in gasoline
     sold in texas ("it was clogging up a lot of carburetors") and toxic
     wastes mixed with oil sold to refineries in oklahoma.  in new york in
     1983, investigators found apartment houses, schools and hospitals that
     had unknowingly bought heating oil contaminated with toxic waste which
     produces toxic fumes like dioxin when burned.
       a bill currently in congress would tighten federal policing of waste
     disposal in order to try to stop this practice.


     10. big bad bird business
         [the chicken industry and the national salmonella epidemic.]
         [source:  "southern exposure," summer 1989, "chicken empires,"
          by bob hall, and "the fox guarding the hen house," by tom
          devine.]

       if you're eating more poultry now because you figure it's healthier
     than red meat, think again.  more and more sick chicks are showing up
     in super-markets these days, contaminated with salmonella bacteria (in
     a quarter to more than half the chicken sold, according to various
     estimates) as a result of speedup in the chicken factories and
     simultaneous easing up of federal inspection (another gift to you from
     the reagan administration).
       in the summer 1989 issue of "southern exposure" magazine, bob hall
     and tom devine put together the big bird picture that hasn't been
     shown elsewhere in the media.  a huge growth in demand for chicken has
     spurred the development of perdue, holly farms, tyson and other giant
     chicken companies, which turn out chickens faster and faster by
     speeding up, not only the birds' life cycle, but also the factory
     production process, almost doubling the number of birds each worker
     processes each minute.  the increase in contaminated chicken, and a
     resulting national epidemic of food poisoning, are caused first by
     that processing speed.  formerly, for example, chickens contaminated
     by feces or factory dirt were discarded--now they are washed together
     with all the other chickens, thus spreading the contamination through
     the washing liquid that has become known in the industry as "fecal
     soup."
       but where are the government inspectors to blow the whistle?  in the
     last ten years the u.s. department of agriculture has reduced their
     numbers, issued new, relaxed inspection guidelines, reprimanded
     inspectors who report health problems and suppressed written reports
     of contaminated meat illegally approved.  now the department is even
     replacing inspectors with chicken company employees it authorizes to
     issue the usda stamp of approval--not surprisingly, companies have
     fired some who took their job too seriously.
       this new chicken business has produced, not only sick chickens, but
     also sick and injured workers--the industry's rate of illness and
     injury is one of the highest in the country.  "southern exposure"
     reports that a 1987 expose on "60 minutes" sparked some national
     coverage, but since then the issue has not been followed.  meanwhile
     the usda is asking for further reductions in inspections and increases
     in the speed of the chicken line.

                          what is project censored?

       the primary objective of "project censored" is to explore and 
     publicize the extent of censorship in our society by locating stories
     about significant issues of which the public should be aware, but is
     not, for one reason or another.
       thereby the project hopes to stimulate responsible journalists to
     provide more mass media coverage of those issues and to encourage the
     general public to demand mass media coverage of those issues or to
     seek information from other sources.
       the essential issue raised by the project in the failure of the mass
     media to provide the people with all the information they need to make
     informed decisions concerning their own lives and in the voting booth. 
       "project censored," an annual nationwide media research project, was
     created in 1976 by dr. carl jensen, professor of communications 
     studies, for a seminar in mass media at sonoma state university.
       sonoma state university, one of the 20 california state universities,
     is a small bu innovative liberal arts and sciences institution located
     50 miles north of san francisco.  the communication studies department
     provides students with a critical as well as practical perspective of
     the mass media.  it offers a b.a. degree in communication studies and
     a certificate program in jouranlism.


                     do you know of any censored stories?

       you can help the public learn more about what is happening in its
     society by nominating stories you feel should have received more 
     coverage by the mass media.  the story should be current and of 
     national social significance.  it may have received no media attention
     at all, appeared in the back pages of your newspaper, or in a small 
     circulation magazine.  to nominate a "best censored story of 1990,"
     just send us a copy of the story including the source and date.  the
     deadline is november 1, 1990.

copyright (c) 1991 by full disclosure. all rights reserved.

this issue of full disclosure is devoted to the current attempts at solving 
the problems of computer security through prosecution of computer crimes.

it would appear from the recent activities of the federal government that one 
of its major attacks is trying to spread fear throughout the ``hacker'' 
community. such a concept will certainly work in a limited number of cases. 
however, as the reading of any local newspaper will show, numerous crimes are 
committed everyday, criminals are not stopped by the fear of punishment.

the other aspect of the government's fear program appears directed towards 
those who have no criminal involvement, who wish to participate in first 
amendment activities by high-technology. some have been subjected to 
punishment without even the allegation of criminal behavior. see related 
article titled ``dr. ripco seizure.'' the result is a fear by some of 
participating in the first amendment, not a legitimate goal of law 
enforcement or the government.

reprinted in this issue is a copy a sentencing memorandum filed by the 
government last year in a computer crime case. it portrays the defendants as 
particularly ``powerful by'' means of the information they stole. missing is 
the fact that the lax nature of computer security is what actually gave the 
defendants power. if the state of computer security been reasonable secure, 
the information obtained by defendants (whether legally or not) would have 
granted them no extraordinary power.

a primary reason the government seeks incarceration as part of the sentence 
is not because of the criminal nature of the defendants activities, but 
rather to send ``the message that the hackers around the country need to 
hear.'' unfortunately, the death penalty has failed to stop murder.

the government appears to be more concerned with the free flow of information 
than the fact that criminal acts were committed; ``[f]rom the start, 
information was stolen and, by definition no longer safeguarded.'' later 
concluding, ``in essence, stolen information equalled power, and by that 
definition, all three defendants were becoming frighteningly powerful.''

the concept that information is the crux of the problem is also highlighted 
by william cook, assistant united states attorney, chicago, illinois in an 
article he wrote for the spring 1990, communicator<m^>*1. he noted that 
hackers can ``easily keep up with industry technical developments.'' he also 
perceives that hackers are able to easily use prior information to form 
attack plans on new computers.

as the soviet union moves toward a more open society, the united states is 
just as surely closing its windows of communication. the united states has 
always been the technological forefront in the world because of the ease of 
information flow. researchers, corporations and individuals have always been 
free to group together and exchange information as desired. this has greatly 
increased the ability of the united states to make technological advances 
quickly.

one can easily see the results by looking at the space programs administered 
by nasa. they have resulted in many inventions finding their way quickly into 
our economy, including rapid improvements in our exports. a few of the things 
that have resulted from nasa's openness with u.s. industry have included: new 
applications such as teflon coatings (frying pans and such), inhalation 
therapy for lung ailments, teflon coatings for asbestos fiber made into 
special apparel for rescue in fires, and many more too numerous to mention.

the phenomenon of information exchange is exactly what william cook describes 
in his article. however, because the ``hackers'' have apparently built or 
made use of a highly efficient communications medium they have been able to 
advance as quick as corporations which have failed to take devote resources 
to advance their informational security. the corporate security departments 
should make use of the same hacker communication techniques to work on their 
problems and see their use of the ``frightening power'' of information lead 
to secure computer systems.

the communications fraud control association (cfca) in its published fraud 
alert of june 21, 1990, is concerned that the government may not be able to 
stop computer crime, if several organizations promising funding for legal 
defense follow through. at risk is the review of several federal and state 
statutes for compliance with constitutional guidelines. to date, even with 
the presence of one such rights organization, the eff<m^><mi^>*2, in at least 
two federal cases, such a review has thus far been thwarted.

in short, we see the cfca's position as allowing only two choices: 1) violate 
the rights of hackers in order to obtain convictions, or 2) the world will be 
runover by a rampage of hacking activities.

two decades ago, the same problems, but with slightly different technology 
was showing its ugly face. the related article in this issue ``the death of 
the blue box'' overviews the legal difficulties the government had in 
prosecuting those stealing telecommunications services.

ultimately, the law enforcement efforts to stop blue boxers were by all 
practical means of measurement a complete failure. only a handful of 
thousands of offenses were prosecuted. those prosecutions proved to have no 
deterrent effect on others. just as we will see that the few recent computer 
hacker prosecutions will do nothing to stem the flow of current day hacking 
and telecommunications fraud.

prosecution of crimes throught to be victimless does little more than to 
strengthen the resolve to not get caught in a very evoluntionary way. the 
solution today is the same as it was in the blue box solution. an upgrading 
of the technology will prevent the simplistic attacks that are so common. the 
first step towards a technological upgrade requires an increase in the 
communication between those experiencing compromise of their data.

the cfca's communicator claims in the february 1990 issue of security 
management to be the only regular journal on telecommunications crime. 
apparently overlooking, cud, 2600 and the non defunct phrack. that is a small 
start towards the free flow of information needed by those who are looking 
for security solutions for their companies.

      a california congressman blasted the federal bureau of investigation for
 violating its charter after the bureau took an official position on the
 controversial rap song "fuck the police", by nwa (niggers with attitudes), a
 group from compton, california.  the congressman's move came in the wake of
 an fbi letter sent to nwa's label, priority records, that condemned the song
 for "advocating violence and assault" against police.
      "this smacks of censorship, and the fbi shouldnt be in the business of
 censorship", said congressman don edwards, democrat of san jose, california,
 who is chairman of a house subcommittee that monitors the bureau's
 activities.  edwards -- a former g-man himself -- contacted the fbi on
 october 10th, objecting to its letter about nwa and demanding a full
 explanation.  in addition, the american civil liberties union in washington,
 dc, protested the fbi's action and called on the justice department to
 retract the letter.
      members of nwa would not comment on the issue, although group member and
 songwriter ice cube previously called the track a "revenge fantasy" stemming
 from what nwa views as repeated police harassment of young blacks. priority
--more-- records chief bryan turner said, "we dont advocate violence in any way, shape
 or form, but we do advocate freedom of speech."  turner recently returned
 from the soviet union, where he lined up a russian distribution deal for
 priority albums that could include "straight outta compton", which contains
 the inflammatory tune.
      the fbi's letter, signed by assistant director and bureau spokesman milt
 ahlerich, claimed the angry rap number "encourages violence against and
 disrespect for the law enforcement officer", describing the "unprecendented"
 surge in violent crime and detailing statistics of police murders during
 1988.  concluding that "music plays a significant role in society", the
 letter ended on an ominous note, warning priority "to be aware of the fbi's
 position relative to this song and its message."
      earlier this year, the song became subject of an intense fax campaign
 among local police departments, with the lyrics transmitted to cops in cities
 where nwa toured.  the number was deliberately excluded from the tour's
 regular set list, but when a few lines of "fuck the police" were chanted at a
 detroit concert, a scuffle broke out, and group members were later briefly
 detained by local authorities.

  jello biafra was until recently lead singer, lyricist, and chief songwriter  
of the san francisco-based punk rock group dead kennedys, one of the leading   
undergound bands in the country.  he also operates alternative tentacles       
records, their own recording label.  he came fourth place in the 1979 san      
francisco mayoral election, won by diane feinstein.  on june 2, 1986 biafra    
was charged by the los angeles city attorney's office with distributing        
harmful matter to minors.  the charge stemmed from dead kennedy's inclusion    
in their third album, frankenchrist, of a poster by oscar award-winning        
swedish artist h.r. giger, entitled landscape no.xx: where are we going?       
biafra and four other defendants intend to plead not guilty; the american      
civil liberties union is assisting in biafra's defense, challenging the        
constitutionality of the charge.  since that time, the dead kennedys' have     
broken up, an event the associate editor of rolling stone magazine termed "a   
real loss to the american scene".  to raise the necessary funds to fight this  
case, biafra helped to form the san francisco-based no more censorship         
defense fund.  he now tours various parts of the country giving talks on the   
issue of censorship, and performing "spoken word" readings of his poetry and   
lyrics.  his musical activities will probably remain on ice for some time to   
come.

    i was half asleep in the attic of my rented flat on april 15th of last     
year when i was startled by nine police officers tearing my place apart.       
they had broken a window by the front door in order to get in.  they claimed   
they had knocked but i had not heard them.  the police were hoping, i think,   
to find the original giger painting, or better yet, giger himself, and were    
disappointed to learn that the painting was hanging in aa private collection   
in france and that giger lived in switzerland.  with their vaguely-worded      
search warrant, they looked through so many places that it was quite obvious   
they were hoping to find drugs or weapons as well as anything pertaining to    
the set-up of a harmful matter bust.  (the search warrant said nothing about   
drugs or weapons.)  they were again disappointed.  they found nothing of this  
type since we don't touch that sort of thing in the first place.               
                                                                               
    all this apparently started just the day before christmas of 1985, when a  
teenage girl bought the frankenchrist album as a present for her younger       
brother.  upon seeing the poster, their mother wrote a letter of complaint to  
the california attorney general's office, the los angeles city attorney's      
office, and on april 15th both my flat and the offices of the record company   
i own, alternative tentacles records, were raided by the police - three        
officers from los angeles and six from san francisco.                          
                                                                               
    criminal charges were levelled against me, the by then ex-general manager  
of our record company, the distributor, the wholesaler in los angeles, and a   
67-year-old man who owns the record pressing plant that actually manufactured  
the posters and inserted the poster in the albums.  the charges were           
announced to the press on june 2nd, the day before primary elections in        
california.                                                                    
                                                                               
    i see this prosecution as a direct result of a nation-wide climate of      
hysteria created by an orchestrated power play by forces on the far right to   
set in motion a pattern of censorship that will allow them to censor anything  
they find 'objectionable'.  there are already movements to purge 'the wizard   
of oz, 'the catcher inthe rye', and many other books out of the public         
schools, and remove or qualify the mention of darwin's theory of evolution in  
school science text-books.  the recent u.s. district court ruling in alabama   
striking down the use of any textbook that mention what the judge classified   
as "secular humanism" resulted from a lawsuit partly orchestrated by the       
judge himself and funded by tv evangelist pat robertson.                       
                                                                               
    yet rock music, and particularly underground and independent rock music,   
has become one of the far-rights' most convenient targets.  ideally, what      
such groups are hoping to do is set in motion a domino effect, similar to      
what happened with 7-11 and other conveniance stores pulling playboy and       
penthouse off their shelves after that under-the-table threat letter from the  
ed meese inquisition saying that these stores would be labeled 'peddlers of    
pornography' unless such magazines were removed.  lo and behold, less than a   
month later, the wal-mart drug store chain, with stores throughout the         
midwest, south, and southeastern seaboard pulled rolling stone, creem, tiger   
beat and 30 other publications pertaining to rock music off their shelves on   
the grounds that they too were 'pornographic'.  who was it that threatened     
wal-mart by branding these magazines pornographic?  not ed meese, but tv       
evangelist jimmy swaggert!  since when has a religion-for-profit exhorter      
been allowed wield this much power?                                            
                                                                               
    we have truly reached a low point in our history when self-appointed       
guardians such as jerry falwell and pat robertson are presented as valid       
spokesmen for the american mainstream.  thinking people are aware they         
represent nothing of the kind, yet at times it seems otherwise because the     
far-right is better organized and more widely exposed than at any time in the  
recent past.  their success so far in advancing their adgenda is at least      
partly due to the fact that people are characteristically silent in this       
country until something reaches their own raw nerve and threatens their        
personal comfort and cocoon.  when a few loudmouths on the far right begin     
harping at grocery stores or at local school boards, and the majority fail to  
take notice and respond, the school board or retailer feels it has no choice   
but to give in to the high-pressure tactics, exaggerations, and outright lies  
employed by the far right.                                                     
                                                                               
    enter the pmrc (parents music resource center), a pressure group formed    
by the wives of several congressmen and a member of president reagan's         
cabinet.  like so many far right groups, they masquerade their real goals      
behind the ruse of the 'concerned parent'.  that time-honored cry of 'what     
about our children?' has always been an effective tool for getting attention.  
                                                                               
    the pmrc operates as a secret society, complete with tax-exempt status.    
they claim they have no membership (only founders) and refuse to divulge       
their sources of financing.  their start-up money apparently came from a rock  
musician, mike love of the beach boys.  now their backers reportedly include   
noted arch-conservative fundraiser and reagan kitchen-cabinet member joseph    
coors of the coors brewing family.                                             
                                                                               
    the co-founders of the pmrc are susan baker, wife of treasury secretary    
james a. baker iii, and tipper gore, wife of presidential aspirant senator     
albert gore, jr.(d-tenn).  their avowed purpose is to force record companies   
to bypass the law and censor their own releases by slapping movie-style 'r'    
or 'x', or at the very least parental advisory warning labels on the album     
covers of artists they deem 'morally objectionable.' what is 'morally          
objectionable'?  according to the pmrc's 'rock music report', it is any song   
dealing with rebellion, substance abuse, sexual promiscuity, perversion,       
'violence-nihilism', or their definition of the occult.  ironically, they      
voice next to no objection to violent tv shows or opera and country-western    
music lyrics.                                                                  
                                                                               
    besides a rating system, they call for lyrics to be printed on album       
covers whether the artist deems it appropriate or not, and covers deemed       
'explicit' to be kept under the counter.  more dangerously, they call for the  
're-assessment of contracts of performers' they claim 'engage in violent or    
explicit sexual behaviour' on stage.  their so-called 'media-watch' asks       
citizens and record companies to pressure broadcasters not to air              
'questionable' artists.  many chain shopping malls have already threatened to  
evict any record store that stocks any item carrying any kind of warning       
sticker whatsoever, including the 'explicit material warning advisory'         
warning label the pmrc proposes.  this not only amounts to censorship, but a   
partial and all-too-ominous black-balling of the artist himself.               
                                                                               
    the joke stopped being funny in the fall of 1985 when the pmrc wives       
arranged for the u.s. senate commerce technology and transportation committee  
to hold public hearings on obscenity in rock, even though no legislation was   
actually being considered.  five of the wives' husbands were on that           
committee.                                                                     
                                                                               
    the mainstream record industry has been all too silent about this power    
play towards censorship.  very few major artists, with the exception of frank  
zappa, have spoken out against this subject in interviews.  zappa has even     
wound up spending over $70,000 of his own money, and at least one year of his  
time, trying to raise the awareness of music enthusiasts to the growing        
threat of censorship and blackballing.  why isn't the industry backing him up? 
                                                                               
    it appears members of the recording industry association of america        
(riaa) have agreed to censor their own artists by playing ball with the wives  
in hopes their husbands will ram a tax on blank recording tapes and/or         
cassette tape recorders through congress.  they claim this tax ($0.01 per      
minute of tape, $.90 on a 90-minute tape at the wholesale price) will          
reimburse musicians who lose royalties when listeners tape their albums at     
home.  this is complete fraud.  in reality, 90% of this tax would go directly  
to the record companies, with only %10 to the artist, a $250 million           
windfall.  even the artists' %10 would be divided according to whoever sold    
the most units, thus ensuring the smaller artists would get nothing.  this     
also means that if i were to buy a cassette tape and a recorder to tape, say,  
a classroom lecture or correspondence memos, i would wind up paying a royalty  
to michael jackson.  i hardly think that's fair, yet this is why major record  
companies continue to cooperate with the censors.                              
                                                                               
   ours is a test case.  i have no doubt that if someone as popular as         
madonna, prince, or ozzy osbourne were charged as we are, the record           
companies would give them the best legal help money could buy.  but            
alternative tentacles and i are a self-supported, self-managed independant     
artist and record company, and are therefore the easiest to destroy through    
bankruptcy.  an official said on network television news that they picked us   
to prosecute because "we feel this is a cost-effective (our emphasis) way of   
sending a message that....we are going to prosecute."                          
                                                                               
   it is also curious that the record store responsible for the actual sale,   
an outlet of the giant wherehouse chain, was not charged in this case, on the  
grounds that "they were cooperative and took the record off the shelves."      
this same prosecuting official also told the national law journal in the july  
28, 1986 issue:  "we don't feel that the city attorney's office is in charge   
of protecting [the daughter of the mother who complained] from this:  we are   
responsible for seeing that the dead kennedys don't profit from the sale of    
this sort of merchandise[.]"                                                   
                                                                               
    the major reason we are fighting this charge instead of taking a slap on   
the wrist, paying a fine, and negotiating away the jail sentence is that a     
conviction would have ramifications far beyond this case.  a legal precedent   
set by such a conviction could only open the floodgates nationwide for         
further charges and harassment against other artists, big and small.  not      
just underground artists, but also folk artists, as well as some of the        
journalists who are being kept out of the country by the ins would be          
affected.  we hope that fighting this charge will help stop this lurch         
towards blackballing dead in its tracks.                                       
                                                                               
    the rippling effect of a mccarthy-style chill factor has already taken     
its toll.  contrary to media predictions, there has been no dramatic rise in   
our record sales as a result of the publicity surrounding this case.  in       
fact, many retailers have already removed our records from their shelves in    
fear of being dragged down to the nearest kangaroo court by the local          
gendarmes.  they know too well how easy it is to go broke defending            
themselves, even if they win in court.  people have written in from all over   
the country, saying they can no longer find dead kennedy records in their      
local stores, especially chain stores.                                         
                                                                               
    another alarming example of possible blackballing is the banishment of     
john denver from rca records.  until recently rca was owned by general         
electric, one of the world's largest arms manufacturers.  john denver, a       
veteran and very successful rca recording artist, included a song attacking    
the arms race on his last lp.  after his album was released denver testified   
against the censorship warning sticker proposal at the senate hearings.  soon  
afterwards, rca dropped john denver - someone who has sold tens, if not        
hundreds of millions of records for them.  sure, denver's sales have been      
declining, but would rca have dropped frank sinatra or elvis presley?          
                                                                               
    turning now to the poster itself, when i first saw h.r. giger's work, i    
was very impressed, emotionally affected, and even uplifted by it.  the art    
that truly inspires me is the kind that jolts the dormant sediment in my       
brain and gets thoughts spinning and whirling so ideas pop into my head, and   
i am then inspired to create on my own.  i had not seen any visual art that    
had affected me this deeply since viewing the work of hieronymus bosch.        
'landscape no.xx', in particular made me think, "my god, here it is, this is   
how we treat each other every day in a consumer-orientated society,            
intentionally or as a self-defense mechanism this is consumer culture on       
parade!"  this painting portrayed to me a vortex of exploitation, that         
vicious circle of greed where one of us will exploit another for gain and      
wind up looking over our shoulder lest someone do the same thing to us in      
return.  i realized that many of these same themes ran like a thread through   
the songs slated to be on the 'frankenchrist' album, which we were in the      
process of recording at the time.  i felt that we should include this piece    
of artwork as a kind of crowning statement of what the record was tryng to     
say, musically, lyrically and visually.  the constitution implies that it is   
up to the individual to make that decision, not the state or self-appointed    
surrogate parents in washington, dc to make it for them.                       
                                                                               
    we do not feel the mother who complained about the poster had a valid      
complaint.  nothing we have ever included on one of our records or in an       
album cover was intended to be harmful to anyone.  but even if she thought it  
was harmful it is the height of irresponsibility by a parent to be so lazy as  
to expect the police to do one's parenting for them.  if my kid brought home   
home something that i thought was harmful, the last thing i would do would be  
to call the police and try to have the artist arrested.                        
                                                                               
    but let me mention first what i would consider harmful.  if my kid         
brought home something like 'top gun' on videotape, or one of those blatantly  
nationalistic, racist, or sexist heavy metal albums that promote beating or    
sexual assault of women, or some whisky-drenched country-western song where    
the guy brags about beating or shooting his wife, or a rambo-type toy - yes,   
that would rub my fur the wrong way.  what, after all, encourages kids more    
kids to go out and get killed, ozzy osbourne records or armed forces'          
recruiting ads?  i do not feel, however, that any of the above should be       
censored.  that's not what the constitution says.  i would rather reply to     
and expose stupidity in media through my own artwork, and make it an issue     
that way.                                                                      
                                                                               
    nor would i abdicate my parental responsibility and chicken out and call   
the cops.  i wouldn't even confiscate the offending article, because that      
would not teach the kid that the article could be harmful or misconstrued.     
such an action on my part would only serve to reinforce the notion that daddy  
is a fascist, or that daddy is mean, or worse yet an uptight jerk who just     
doesn't understand.                                                            
                                                                               
    what i would do is sit down with the kid and say "look, you went out and   
brought home this item.  why?  why did you buy this?  why do you like it?      
what do you see in this?  how does it affect you?  how do you think it might   
affect someone else? and now let me tell you what i think of it and how it     
affects me."  a meaningful discussion is a far healthier way to help nurture   
a loving family than is discipline with no rational explanation to back it     
up.  such a breakdown in communication might also encourage the kid to simply  
sneak the offending artical home and hide it.                                  
                                                                               
    more generally, dead kennedys have always used their art as political      
speech.  one element of the band has always been journalism.  through our      
songs we have exposed issues around us that our audience might not ever even   
have heard of otherwise, since many people their age who listen to records     
were brought up on television and hardly ever read books and newspapers.       
                                                                               
    if we are successful in defending ourselves on this charge, we hope a      
dismissal will help slam the door on prosecutions of rock musicians for what   
they say with their records, and artists and journalists for what they say     
with their work.  and perhaps ultimately we would be able to send a message    
to public officials who think they need to hop on the censorship bandwagon in  
order to avoid attacks from wealthy far right wing fringe groups or attract    
funding from the same right wing political action committees, by saying that   
perhaps this is not such a lucrative issue after all since it makes the        
person doing the harrassing out to be the pompous jerk he or she really is.    
                                                                               
    censorship is like that certain brand of potato chips.  nobody can stop    
with just one.  well-organized and financed pressure from the far right has    
already dealt a serious blow to what we see, read, hear - and ultimately       
think.  people once viewed as dangerous right-wing extremists have succeeded   
in casting themselves as spokespeople of the american mainstream.  in their    
world music and literature can be judged harmful, yet star wars is considered  
perfectly safe.  and genocide squads like the nicaraguan contras are "the      
moral equivalent of our founding fathers."                                     
                                                                               
    libraries and textbooks are under new attacks in schools.  many gifted     
artists now face possible blackballing.  urinalysis and lie detector tests at  
work are actively being promoted by the reagan administration under the        
continuing guise of a drug scare.  attorney general edwin meese has used a     
wildly-contrived "study" of "pornography" as the first step in a crusade to    
widen the crackdown on free speech.  his commission threatens magazine         
retailers through extra-legal manuevers such as threat letters, while he       
strives to pack the federal court system with avowed enemies of                
constitutional liberties.                                                      
                                                                               
    a fresh pmrc media blitz again has them in the news, with new censorship   
via warning label proposals.  their tone is more concilitory now, with their   
more volatile edges temporarily masked.  they compare the rock music they      
deem "objectionable" to the violence on television many of the rest of us      
have problems with, yet they still concentrate their attack on one form of     
music - rock - and barely address the issue of television at all.  what about  
all the families bombrded every night by the violence seen on the six o'clock  
news?                                                                          
                                                                               
    history has shown us that any compromise with cultural vigilantes just     
encourages more of them to go further.  the hysteria sparked by the pmrc       
husbands' senate hearings is what gave jimmy swaggart's views front page       
respectibility in the first place.                                             
                                                                               
    the rationale behind freedom of speech has always been that truth emerges  
out of open debate.  democracy assumes a variety of voices, each trying to     
persuade the other.  dissent is healthy, even when presented in a a manner     
which may seem abhorrent or obscene to those who fear direct confrontation     
with the reality that surrounds us.  only an informed population can make      
responsible choices.

records.  they are a relatively small record company that deals mostly
in alternative and hardcore punk music.  it is owned and operated by a
man named jello biafra. he used to be the lead singer of one of the
greatest punk bands to ever exist, the dead kennedys.  definitely on par
with the sex pistols in pioneering the punk field.  he is still going
strong with several new projects and singing with a lot of different bands.
he has had several albums out since the break up of the dead kennedys after
going to trial for a piece of art from a famous artist named h.r. giger.
some of these albums are:

lard: power of lard
lard: the last temptation of reid (new)
jello biafra with d.o.a.: the last scream of the missing neighbors (new)
jello biafra and nomeansno: untitled

        jello is also sponsoring the no censorship fund based out of
the offices of alternative tentacles records.  if you want any information
about alternative tentacles, or the no censorship fund, then send 
requests and/or money to:

newspapers
----------

        a few semesters ago, there were around six rapes within a 3 month
span on the isu campus.  if you will think back, you will notice that 
you didn't read about this in the indiana statesman or the tribune star.
in fact, you didn't read about thin in anything!  isu is a very power-
ful state institution that gets what it wants when it wants it.  what
does this say about our opressive government?  half of the people 
reading this will probably forget about it tomorrow, or just don't
give a damn now.  what does that say about our society and what it does 
to it's offspring?
        we wouldn't want to print something bad about our lovely state
owned and operated campus now would we?  we wouldn't want to say anything
about the hella lame police force that can't stop rapes from happening
because they are too busy eating doughnuts and chasing skateboarders.
the worst part about the whole damn thing is the fact that it was
all smoothed over and forgotten about.  if people aren't informed of
the past, then the past repeats itself.  how many more of those girls
do you think would have been raped if the first one would have been
talked about?  start watching for this kind of thing to happen from
now on.  it happens all of the time.

the information crunch
----------------------

        this article will only cite a couple of examples of our
wonderful government trying to stop us from getting information they
deem unlawful for us to possess. this is a violation  of our 
constitutional rights. only a few can be cited from the simple fact
that there are too many to talk about!  the sheep are easier to drive 
when they don't know they are going to the slaughterhouse.
        first of all, i will mention a little something about nbc news.
if you follow the lines of ownership back, you will find that nbc is 
a subsidiary of rca records (another form of information distribution),
which is in turn owned by general electric.  general electric is the 
largest manufacturer of nuclear arms and nuclear power in our country.
what i ask of you, the reader, is to see if you can find anything about
accidents with nuclear waste or spills on the nbc news.  what you might
also want to look for is rca artists (still employed by rca) singing
about nuclear weapons and/or toxic waste.  john denver was dropped
from the rca record label right after he released an album that spoke
out against nuclear arms.
        our friends, the federal communications commission (fcc) have 
been going on a rather large witch hunt to destroy a very popular
underground computer magazine called phrack.  a little history 
on phrack seems to be in order here for those of you who are 
unfamiliar with the publication.  phrack stands for phreak/hack.
phreaking is the art of knowing just what buttons to push and what 
tones to send when having phun with the phone company.  hacking is
not what the tv programs portray it to be.  hacking is dealing with
very competent computer users who are able to find security holes in 
large computer operating systems and networks.
        this magazine was started by two hackers with the aliases
taran king and knight lightning.  it is many years old and was first
made on old apple ii computer systems.  the magazine spread information
to the computer underground, which by the time it was out, the information
was no longer useful.
        the fcc has now forcibly entered the homes of the phrack writers,
taken their computer systems (never to return them), and stolen
their mailing lists.  the fcc is also going through the mailing list
busting anyone who subscribed to the magazine for possessing the 
information.  however, the law states that holding information is
not unlawful, but the use of information to perform illegal actions
is unlawful.  they are getting away with this, and nobody is doing
anything about it.  if you would like to see the phrack that talks
about the busts (they didn't get them all!), then drop us a line
to our p.o. box in the back of this rag, and we can make arrangements.
leave us a phone number and a first name.  we can also give you any
issue number of any underground computer magazine, we have them all.
activist times inc., computer underground digest, phun, pirate, narc,
and papers.
        here is a little note i would like to leave you to think
on before i end this article.  take a look at any new elementary
or junior high school text book and see how much information you 
can find on the united states dropping the bomb on hiroshima.  it's
not even mentioned!

smack attack
------------

        our government has a philosophy.  if they pull off a dirty deed
and nobody finds out for 15 years, then it becomes so much worthless
paper. i assume everyone has heard of the facts behind the movie air
america.  during the viet nam war, the cia smuggled smack into the 
united states with a bogus airline called air america.  now, the 
government does not care if you know.  that was 15 years ago, right?
wrong!  that might very well be today.  what is supposed to make us
think anything has changed?  they can smuggle in drugs now better than
they could then.  the drugs make good fuel to feed the "drug crisis"
fires at home so the people will think their government is looking out
for them.  from the knowledge that the government used people to test
the effects of lsd on in the 60's we can come to the conclusion that
they know more about it and it's possible uses than we do.  it could
be very possible that people are much easier to control when their
brain is thrashed on drugs.  just say no?  say no to drugs, or no to 
your government?  we need change!  we need a government that cares,
and so does the rest of the world.

        well, if you haven't thrown this away yet, then we would like 
to thank you for reading!  consider yourself and open minded person.
this is my "tidying up" article to attempt to strengthen my beliefs
and observations i have put forth in the earlier articles.
        there are so many lies and cover ups going on in the world today,
that it is difficult to tell what is truth and what is fiction.  most
of our baby kissing politicians spend their time trying to find loop
holes in the constitution (or just plain ignoring it altogether) in
order to tighten the noose of militarism.  if they can't get around
the constitution, then they just use economical black mail.  if you
know what happened to the 7-11s and wall mart, then you will know what
i am talking about. the philosophical disease of trying to keep the 
peasants productive has gone on for too long.  it seems it is too late 
to turn it around.  this isn't true.  if enough people jump on the band 
wagon, we could save ourselves before we all drown.
        as children, the system works through it's slow-to-build 
prototypes (the previous generation) to try and control our thoughts
and actions.  as you grow up, you begin to like the blinders you are
wearing and just look upon our governments actions with adoring eyes
never pierce that false shell of kindness.  when you finally get put
into your "chosen" profession, you work the best years of your life
away in order to exist.  there are too many things missed, and too
little shared.  as you grow older and a little less productive, you 
start to reach retirement age.  oh yes, the golden years, when you
turn 65, start trying to live off of social security and if you're lucky,
a pension.  all those years of work to be thrown out in the end to die
alone.  just like the sheep model society has molded you into.

what's the point?

        i'm sure some of you are thinking of a few questions you would
like to ask us or have something you wold like to point out.  we would 
like to clear up a few things right away to maybe clear up a couple
of possible questions.
        you probably noticed a lot of these articles are pretty vague
about some things.  these weren't meant to tell you what is right and
what is wrong.  they were meant to cast a "shadow" of our thoughts onto
your thinking.  the main point, however, was to make you start to think
and maybe open up your eyes and your mind a little wider before you take
a look at the world.
        we've gotten a lot of hell in the past for speaking out, and we
have done this kind of thing before.  as long as there are people that
get pissed off because our views our different or wrong in their eyes,
than we will keep publishing.  you can call us names, or chase us down,
but that won't change us, and we stand by our values.  we are out of
step with the world and not ashamed of it.

if you are interested in mailing us your questions, comments, or even
articles of your own, then go for it.  we have obtained a post office
box for this purpose.  who wants to give out our real address, we would

give up trying to go through the p.o. box, dead end there...  if you send

     this article is dedicated to metalheads, racist/fascist
skins, homophobes, and senseless, violent assholes who think
they know where it's at.  whatever possessed you to come into the 
punk/hardcore scene?  yeah, maybe when punk started getting 
publicity in 74-75 some of the exposed bands put a bad rap on 
themselves by being obnoxious on t.v. and screaming the simple 
term "anarchy" with no real definition behind it.
     eventually, hardcore came out in the 80's.  bands who were 
punk in some ways, "hippy-like" in other ways were singing 
intelligent lyrics about peaceful world unity.  anarchy and peace, 
freedom of expression, smashing racism, and doing away with 
oppressive governments.  well, that was then and this is now.  i 
guess that is all i can say now in disappointment.
     when the metal and skinhead type attitudes popped into the 
scene around 84 or so, things started to go down the drain.  yes 
folks, the time had come to take off your "thinking" caps and put 
on your football helmets and kick some ass.  do you realize how 
hard it is to tell some of the metal/punks out there what 
anarchism really means?  it's like talking to a jackass.  then 
again, a jackass is a little smarter. talking to the nazi skins and so 
called anti-racists, proud american skins is like talking to a 
pre-programmed robot.  so, take your stupid homophobe, racist, 
violent, bald headed ideas and rub them in a pile of bullshit 
where you and your ideas belong.
     remember when shows used to have real pits.  some bouncing 
every which way, occassionally see your friend bounce by, help 
each other when you fall?  now it's "mosh dude", run in a boring
ass circle and stomp on those who fall down.
     punk is on it's life support machine again.  can it be saved?  
or are you going to let those who think anarchy means violence, 
peace sucks, anti-everything different, fake skinhead fuckers take 
over our scene?  i'm not.  if you aren't either than that's one 
step forward.  then you just get a friend to believe that, and 
he/she to do the same and we're on the way to bringing our scene
back to what it was.  peaceful, nihilistic anarchism.  freedom to 
all, love to all (even the people i've just spoken against, maybe 
they'll wise up) and up with individualism.

old pink on everything
   let me start by saying i was going to bang off about 8 million little
articles on a lot of topics, but i opted for a few real long articles that
ramble.  so, as co-editor, i will ignore the chicago and the ap & upi and
the new york times... i am in control, so i will ramble.

nomeansno:  this is a group that has a lot to say.  i only have a few of
their works, but they rule.  small parts isolated and destroyed and wrong
are the two i have, and from this sample (hell, it's 50% of their discography)
i think this band will go far.  we couldn't categorize them, so i just called
it psychopunk.  i guess it fits.

tipper gore / pmrc / religious right / jello biafra:
this is one topic that gets me hot: censorship.  if you listen to the people
talk, they sound reasonable; it's not like putting a label on a record
stopped it from being produced, right?  wrong.  john denver, super mellow guy,
got kicked off his label for telling the tipper squad to stuff it.  not saying
this is bad or anything of that nature, i'm sure he'll do well, but to quote
"if john denver tells you you have your head up your ass, isn't it entirely
possible you have your head up your ass?"  someone as lame and innocent as
that gets the axe, and it's not censorship.  something doesn't connect here.

so the pmrc hearings got our pal canned, and produced some startling non-
revelations: who funds the pmrc?  where does the cash come from?  a clue:
your tithing brothers of gawd.  the religious right sees fit to quash any
type of thought that does not follow the conventions of the church, and they
do so under the guise of 'concerned parents'.  who wouldn't give a sawbuck
to hear a concerned mom bitch about evil music? who got all this going,
anyway?  who released the studies to get the ball rolling?

the ku klux klan.

the kkk released the original reports of the affectations, which caused the
music of 'the negro' to be banned from 'white' airwaves.  this persecution &
prosecution of music continued on into the 80's, where tipper says that the
music of the occult underground is driving our kids to do heinous things.
right.  i was doing heinous things long before i ever heard of the dead
kennedys.

i really am just paraprhasing jello, so i'd ask you all to buy a tape or two:
(1) jello biafra spoken word album, and jello biafra tales of the trial.
(2) some dk tape (pick one, my fav is frankenchrist).

if you know me, ask me to borrow (borrow) my copies... i'll loan you the
disks,and make you ill.

oh yes: the religous right, they funded the publication of tipper's book.
that's a tie-in i forgot.

get stupid get violent:  when you read this, and you get hot, and want to kick
our asses and show us who's tough, don't.  go put out your own paper, or hold
talks.  i'm trying to get jello to come to terre haute (dre-e-e-e-eam...) to
speak to isu, but if i can't i want to say what i think is important without
getting the shit knocked out of me.  if you disagree with us, write us, get
a hold of us, mail us on the nets... do something.  but don't prove us right
by trying to nail us.  we already think you need awakened or we wouldn't be
doing this.  don't show you're too stupid to learn to listen.

i sk8 hardc0re, don't tell me i d0n't:
well, ok bud, but i'd like to talk about some shit that everyone on this
campus think's cool but isn't.  it's skate harassment.  i skate a little,
and i get tired of the shit spewing from the preppy asses in low riding trucks
painted stupid colors with plastic regular fucks in the seat beside them.
what's a real gas is you don't stop and back yourself up, you just yell and
run.  that's weak.  when we say come back, it's not a bluff.  come back and
we'll fight back, but i have yet to see a skate go 60 so we can't catch you.
it's the perfect crime, but what's funny is when we attack you.  you run and
grab about 80 drug crazed stupid fucking preps who run up, yell, and run
off.  you're sad.  fight back or go away.

racism:
new hot topic, racism in the schools.  it's real, folks, and i'm just world
weary enough to know one article in some degenerate publication isn't going
to change your views, but i ask you to think next time you let loose with a
big string of 'goddamnniggerfuckingsonofabitchingassholejunglemonkeychick
wetbackchinowearinggoon' into the world, you look to see who's standing
next to you.  they might not like it.  and you may find out what it's like
to eat a knuckle sandwich.

'liberals'
here's one that really pisses me off, these self deemed liberals that are
so right wing they make nixon look good.  i work with one, let's call her
margret.  oh that's her real name, oops.  well her ideas are that music is
too free, the government needs to clamp down on this porno-rock, that jesse
helms rules, that penthouse readers should be prosecuted, and the
newspapers need to be shut up.  and then she has the gall to say 'but i'm a
liberal on these issues'.  she's not the first one i've met, and probably
not the last.  not even the worst, just the most recent.  i'd just ask if
you must hold views, stick up for yourself and slip into your niche.  don't
pose, say 'i'm a conservative' not 'liberal except for speech' or whatever.

i ventured to the land of texas/to watch the sea tumble over the sand
what i watched instead/was the waste of man.

the sun rose and set over the sea/the black cloudy water washed over me
i slid into the gulf of mexico/and landed in waste from texaco

i thought life wasn't so bad/in younger years i wasted
but the world is small,/the land basted.

the sea is dead and rotting/the world is turning black
all the while the fisherman/are stabbing us in the back.

no i lied, here it is quite a few weeks after this was supposed to come out but
no, i quit my job and lost my photocopier access. sucks! so here it is, me
rambling on about religion and shit again. sorry to bore.

religion:
i was walking to the bookripoffcenter the other day, and there was this
guy there, yelling about god and all that shit.  so, i took it upon myself
to yell back.  i was the guy in the grey trenchcoat ans shorts, if you were
there.  i was offering some serious alternatives to religion; all this guy 
could come back to my questions with was some wiseass crack about wearing
shorts in the cold.  i asked him questions, and all he did was yell about god.
lame. my alternatives were these:
   1) don't believe in god, believe in yourself. you, and only you,
      have the power to make yourself a better person.  no god will
      show you a better path, it's up to you to make one. there are
      no wrong and right ways to do it, folks. just follow your own
      ideas.  don't sell your mind for the euphoria of belonging
      to a group of sheep.  sure, you're always welcome, but you
      sure do get the hairy eyeball for not putting a little something
      in the plate.  hmmm? you know, the principle of the collection
      plate was to take if you were needy and give if you could, and
      to be humble and not worry about it if you were on the giving or
      recieving side.  so next time you go to church, count the homeless.
      count the destitute.  if i showed up on your doorstep, you'd call
      the cops.  you're afraid of yourself the most.  when you raise your
      voice at your kids, doesn't it raise doubts in your head?

what happened???
----------------

	when i look back on the salad days, i remember i used to have
a lot of friends in grade school.  real friends, not like the 
superficial ones everyone seems to have today.  we all played together
and had a lot of fun at school.  no one really seemed to belong to 
a group.  we were all just together.  
	then we all reached junior high school.  things weren't so
fun anymore.  people started paying attention to who had the best
clothes and the most money at lunch time.  it started to seperate into
groups.  we didn't talk together so much because we wouldn't want our
new and better friends to disown us for our other friends.
	well, now we are through with junior high and we go to high
school.  all kinds of new people here.  i guess we better make a much
bigger impressions to get better friends.  pay for our friendship,
that is the only way.
	we got into much more defined groups and decided not only not
to talk to each other anymore, but to hate each other.  it was much 
easier than putting on the fake smile.  we have to think about our
new friends and our careers, we don't have time for the other people.
	now we have reached college.  this is the most important 
phase of our life.  we must impress everyone.  we have to choose our
groups wisely.  it is tough to decide which fraternity/sorority to 
join.
	as i see it, this is all a bunch of shit.  i see my old 
friends from long ago at college still.  i try to at least greet
them, maybe things can be how they were.  they decide to ignore me.
i don't understand, i though friendship was much more important than
a group of superficial friends all striving to impress the others with
the newest car and the biggest stereo.  he who chugs the mostest, 
becomes the bestest.  you bet!  why can't everyone just be friends
and not try to see who has the biggest wallet and most "friends?"
what happened to everyone?

economic genocide: strawberry flavour available.

	we all know what is happening to the world.  the environment
is going down the tubes.  toxic waste is killing the wildlife, and 
it is killing us as well.  when the low elements of the food chain 
die, we all die.  environmentalists are trying their hardest to stop
it all from happeneing by attacking the big corporations who are 
destroying the earth where we all have to live. 
	i have a message for all of the environmentalists out there:
you are attacking all the wrong people.  you are one very small step
off.  we have to stop the powers behind it all.  the politicians are
the ones at the top.  we have to stop the people who let the 
companies get away with it.  they not only let them get away with it,
but they tell them to do it.  their pocket books are much more important
than the human race.
	we should all go out and vote.  vote for who?  one politician
is just as corrupt as they other.  they may not start out to be, but
they get that way.  all you need is a big wallet, and god in your 
pocket, and you can do anything.  let a company dump a little toxic
waste, then go to church on sunday and ask god for forgiveness for your
sins in the name of the economy and your conscience goes away.
	hell, a little toxic waste never hurt anyone.  at least it
keeps the population from producing.  less people, more money to go 
around.  if you haven't noticed, we have a recession going on.  what
a perfect time to start a little war.  hell, why not pick the middle
east, they are always doing something over there that big brother 
doesn't like.  just ship a few marines over and all of those thousands
of years old racial disputes just go away.  uncle sam knows what is 
right for the world and the economy.  how many times have similiar 
"uprisings" happened in the middle east?  kuwait just happened at 
a perfect time.  we can save the economy with a nice handy little 
war.  i have some news for you all, we have to save our own asses
before we can save kuwait.  the government isn't trying to save
kuwait in the name of humanity, they are trying to save it in the 
economy.
the government is trying to control the economy through the war in
kookwait, and trying to cover up its lack of ability to deal with
our debts, both monetary and humanitarian, by feeding 'endless doses
of sugar coated mindless garbage' in the form of madonna ads, where
she uses sex and cavorts about trying to get you to join the american
way, join the people and vote for ????  ok, so i vote and get laid?
interesting... getting laid is on everyone's mind, and the government
is out there trying to hide the fact that all this sex is destroying us.
don't get me wrong here, but there is an insidous diease running around,
killing off scores of folks... maybe you know someone with aids.  you
will soon, if you don't now.  in a book entitled "the truth about aids",
some doctors from the cdc (center for disease control) and other places
told the public what's up on aids.  but the government, the same one
that you voted in, killed the book.  how? it's not hard. audit a company,
cook the books... and nail them.  this book is now underground... try 
to buy it at walden's.  they'll look real confused and say 'duh, nope!'
aids is killing!  people are dying.  just because the government owned presses
have stopped talking about aids, it doesn't mean it's gone away.

someone once said (no bartlet's... damn) that the job of the people was
to overthrow the goverment once it got to far away from the people. it's
our job to see that the truth gets out. it's your job.  i've been seeing an
increased police presence in the city for a little while... what's up?
someone tell us.

religion: ain't it the shits?
dija read the one about the kids whose parents wouldn't let him go to the
doctor to have a bowel obstruction removed, and tried to faith-heal it away?
he died for the want of some ex-lax, and now the state is suing his parents
for child abuse. what do you think? i think it was the kid's right to live
that outweighed his parent's beliefs in non-medicine, but hey, who am i?

then there's the one about the guy who canned his family for not being in
the way of god.  his livacious, lustful daughter was to far gone.  so he
killed them all.  here's a good article: penthouse, august 1990 issue,
the atrticle is called holy horrors.  it's a neat one, a real gem. fun at
parties, too!

cindi lauper - her lyrics run the gambit [sic] from masturbation to
 prostitution.  her song, "girls just wanna have fun" is filthy.  her
 psychedelic hair and wild outfits are indications of her rebellion and
 anti-establishment ideals.  she gets her spiritual advise [sic] from
 wrestling promoter lou albano.  [comments:  again, i think they meant
 gamut, not gambit.  the reference to masturbation comes from "she-bop",
 i believe.  i have listened to that song many times, and, unlike most
 people, i pride myself on listening to and familiarizing myself with
 lyrics.  the pmrc has also publically denounced this song.  the pmrc
 has called for a ban on songs containing explicit sexual references,
 such as, perhaps, the word "masturbation" as used in prince's "darling
 nikki".  in this song, however, the word never appears.  while the word
 "bop", the reference to beefcake magazines, and the line "they say if
 you don't stop it, y ou'll go blind" (i don't have a lyric sheet, that
 quote may not be exac t) indicate that the subject matter is
 masturbation, i strongly doubt that any of these references would be
 picked up by a seven or ten year old.  smut is in the eye and mind of
 the beholder.]

led zepplin - on the inside of their album, houses of the holy, there is
 a naked man holding up a dead child in sacrifice to a mysterious light
 atop some ruins.  their song, "stairway to heaven" contains many occult
 references and uses backward masking to say, "oh , he is my prince,
 satan . . . the one who lit up the night, lord, you make me shout in
 glory to satan."  jimmy page, a former member of the group, purchased
 alister crowley's (a famous occulist [sic]) masion and owns one of the
 largest occult bookstores in britain.  robert plant, the former lead
 singer, has a fascination for black magic.  plant also blames page's
 "obsession with the occult" for the troubles the group had.  john
 (bonzo) bonham died at page's mansion, choking in his own vomit after
 ingesting forty measures o f vodka.

madonna - rolling stone ma gazine said about her seattle concert,
"madonna seduces seattle".  her song, "like a virgin" is the title song
of her first album.  she says, "i knew when i recorded 'like a virgin',
it would appeal to teenagers with active hormones".

paul mccartney - he and his wife linda were arrested and fined for
possession of marijuana.  mccartney has been known for his open use of
drugs since his days with the beatles.  [comment:  still another
denouncement containing not one reference to the artist's music.]

malcom mcclarn [sic] - "rock n' roll is pagan and primitive and very
 jungle and that's how it should be.  the moment it stops being those
 things it's dead.  that's what rock n' roll is meant to be aobout isn't
 it?  the true meaning of rock . . . is sex, subversion and style. "
 (rock magazine, aug. 1983)

 meat loaf - their [sic] album bat out of hell features a picture of a
demon biker on the cover, and speaks of a mutant biker riding out of the
pits of hell.  compser, jim steinman says, "i've always been fascina ted
by the supernatural and always felt rock was the perfect idiom for it."
he also said, "when i go on stage, i get possessed . . "

melle mel - "i wanted to create my own image.  it's a way of being
anti-christian.  (new sounds magazine, april 1984)

moody blues - "in search of the lost chord" speaks of music whose
vibrations have supernatural properties.  the inside of the album
contains a 'yantra', which is the visual equivalent of a 'mantra' in
t.m.  while the album is being played, the listener is to ld to stare at
the geometric designs and thereby enter an altered state of
consciousness.

motley crue - according to mikki sixx, the lead singer, their aim is to
be the "loudest, sickest band on the planet earth".  he also says, "i
know people who pray for us everyday . . . they can't save us, we're
gone".  "people love sleaze, and we're the sleaziest.  the only type of
women we get have one thing on their mind, sex, that's fine cause that's
all we have in mind."  their second album is entitled shout at th e
devi.  rock scrapbook says it is, "dripping with impure and perverted
lust, it is a call to arms for american youth.  whether it's life on the
street or sex with the high school slut , motley crue shouts out their
message with a vengance [sic].  songs from that album include:  "shout
at the devil", "god bless the children of the beast", "bas---d", which
says, "out go the lights/in goes my knife/pull out his life/consider
that bas---d dead/get on your knees/please beg me, please/you're the
king of the sleaze./don't try to rape me." chorus:  "(bas---d)/consider
that bas---d dead/(bas---d)/won't get screwed again" solo - "whoa!
whoa!/bas---d/make it quick, blow off his head./got your neck in the
noose/i got nothing to loose[sic] /we're really gonna screw
you./consider that bas---d dead./quick as a shark/beast has its mark/you
can't bear the dark/don't you try to rape me."  chorus: solo: chorus.
the song, "knock 'em dead kid", says, "i'm prime for hate.  chorus:
knock 'em dead, kid (knock 'em dead)/ knock 'em dead, kid (knock 'em
dead)/the blade is red, kid (knock 'em dead)/knock 'em dead, kid/knock
'em dead.  and finally, "ten s econds to love" says, "reach down
low/slide it in real slow/i wanna hear your engine roar/before i'm in
the door/you feel so good/do you want some more/i got one more shot/my
gun's still warm/was it hot for you/did you fire this round/the second
i'm through/i'll be leaving this town.

nazareth - "hair of the dog" is an album that pictures demonic
manifestations on the cover.

new riders of the purple sage - they promote drugs by singing songs
like, "acapulco gold" and "panama red", which are two cuts of marijuana.

stevie nicks - according to rolling stone magazine, s he is openly
involved with the occult.  she would like to build her own pyramid and
live in a little "witch house" on a cliff overlooking the ocean.  "i
love the symbolism of the three roses" nicks said, "which is very
pyramid, very maya", occult terms she uses frequently.  [comment:  this
is so nonsensical as to be almost beyond comment.]

ted nugent - he refers to himself as the guitar gunslinger and calls his
music combat rock.  he is quoted as saying, "rock is the perfect primal
method of releasing our violent instinct.  i like to rape the audience."
twleve people died in a riot following one of his concerts in south
carolina.

ohio players - they deliberately use nudity to sell records.  an album
entitled angel unfolds to show a full length nude.  other albums portray
such scenes as a nude covered in honey and another nude suggestively
nuzzling a horse.  [comment:  nudity per se is not sex.  many children
are taken to art museums on class field trips, where they may view
paintings and statues that inclu de nudes or scantily clothed figures.
again, smut is in the eye of the beholder.]

ozzy osbourne - "i'm thinking about starting a school for rock n' roll.
i can teach all my demented ideas to a whole generation . . . that would
be the ultimate revenge."  osbourne once bit the head off a bat in
concert and had to be given rabie [sic] shots.  he has been know to
throw pig instestines into the audience during his concerts.  he has 14
tatoos, including one of the grim reaper on his chest, with the number
666 on it.  he claims he was compelled to see the exorcist 26 times.
his albums include the ultimate sin and speak of the devil, which
includes the songs, "black sabbath", "fairies wear boots", "war pigs",
"the wizzard", "never say die", "sabbath bloody sabbath" and "children
of the grave".  he has been quoted as saying, "i don't know if i'm a
medium for some outside force or not, frankly, whatever it is i hope
it's not what i think it is, satan."  i'm afraid we got some bad news
for you, ozzy!

pink floyd - " the wall" was voted the number one album for 1980 by
rolling stone magazine.  it includes songs like "young lust", plus songs
of violence, drugs and rebellion.  the most popular song on the album,
"another brick in the wall" says, "we don't need no education . . . hey
teacher, leave us kids alone."  [comment:  they left out a line:
"another brick in the wall" also says, "we don't need no thought
control."  in passing, you may find it interesting that during peron's
second administration in a rgentina, the w all (album and movie) was
banned as one of many restrictions placed on expression.  the word
"vector" was banned, too (nobody seems to know just why).  arbitrary
censorship is a mark of many an authoritarian or dictatorial government,
but cannot be tolerated in a democracy.]

police - their song, "murder by numbers" contains the following, "now if
you have a taste for this experience/and you're flushed with your very
first success/then you must try a twosome or a threesome/and you'll find
your conscience bo thers you much less./because murder is like anything
you take to/it's a habit-forming need for more and more/you can bump off
every member of your family/and anybody else you find a bore.

prince - his award wingging album, purple rain is also nothing but pure
garbage.  on the album cover, he says, "the only things i can make
besides eggs is babies."  lyrics describe how he seduces a woman to have
sex with her and then says, "shall i wash you first or you wash me?"
his song, "darling nikki" says, "met a gi rl named nikki,/guess you
could say she was a sex fiend./i met her in a hotel lobby masturbating
with a magazine."  his song, "let's pretend we're married" says, "escuse
me, but i need a mouth like yours to help me forget the girl that just
walked out my door."  rolling stone said of his dirty mind album, "at
it's [sic] best, dirty mind is positively filthy".  songs include, "do
it all night".  [comment:  regarding the first sentence, i do not
consider it the place of such organizations to make value judgme nts
unless they acknowledge that that is their intention, rather than
delivering value judgments in the guise of education and consumer
information.  as to the last sentence, the fact that rolling stone says
something doesn't automatically prove its validity.]

queen - their name is a drag term meaning homosexuality.  freddie
mercury, the bands [sic] lead singer states, "we want to shock and be
outrageous".  their songs include, "we are the champions", which has
become the official anthem of the gay liberat ion movement, and "another
one bites the dust", which incorporates backward masking to say, "start
smoking marijuana".  freddie mercury wears his own special brand of
purple fingernail polish, and onstage, he often strips to hot pants.
their song, "get down make love" is about homosexuality.  lyrics
include, "you take my body, i give you heat,/you say you're hungry, i
give you meat;/i suck your mind, you blow my head,/make love inside your
bed,/everybody get do wn make love."  [comments:  the adoption of a song
as an organization's anthem does not imply an absolute interpretation,
but merely allows a group of people to share a common interpretation.
whether or not "another one bites the dust" contains backward masking
encouraging listeners to smoke marijuana, i have listened to the song
many times, yet have never smoked anything in my life, leading me to one
of two conclusions:  either the backmasking is nonexistent, or backward
masking has no effect on listeners (of course, both could be true).
finally, as far as i can remember, while "get down make love" may be
considered sexually explicit, i cannot recall any mention of
homosexuality in it.]

ratt - they began in a one bedroom apartment.  "you should have seen how
hard it was to have sex there", exclaimed robbin, the king ratt.  when
asked what life on the road was like, he answered, "sodom and gomorrah".

the rolling stones - they have been together for 20 years and into
everything.  sticky fingers is an album whose cover has a real zipper
that can be unz ipped to reveal the underwear of a male with an erection
clearly visible.  "beast of burden" is a song of sado-masochism and many
of their songs deal with occult themes.  "sway" is a song about demon
power.  an earlier album was their satanic majesty's request. goat's
head soup was another album which dealt with the occult.  their song,
"dance with mr. d." is about a midnight dance with the devil in the
graveyard.  another song, "sympathy for the devil" has become an
unofficial anthem for ma ny churches of s atan.  keith richards, their
lead guitarist, was arrested for possession of heroin.  [comment:  i
can't think of anything sado-masochistic about "beast of burden".]

linda ronstadt - in one song, she sings, "i'm on the other side of town,
all strung out on heroin".  in an interview, linda said, "i can perform
better after shooting smack (heroin) in both arms than after eating too
much".  on the back of her greatest hits album she is wearing occult
jewelry.

rush - the album, caress of steel pictures a robed man levitating a
 pyramid, and most of their albums have a pentagram (satanic symbol) on
 the cover.  they perform in front of a pentrgram on stage.  in one of
 their songs, "by-tor and the snow dog", there is a low rumbling sound
 that says, "i want your mind and your body . . . i want you . . . i'm
 by-tor".

santana - carlos santana said, "i am the string and the supreme is the
musician . . . when i'm really in tune with the supreme, my guru, and my
instrument, forget it man, cause it's totally beyong anythi ng - that's
where i want to be".  the song "abraxas" is about the foremost demon
spirit.  other songs include, "black magic woman" and "evil ways".
[comments:  the quote from santana seems very spiritual to me.  whether
or not he's talking about the same god in which i believe (and i have no
indication that he's referring to another), i find inspiration in those
who wish to be tools of their maker.  as for "evil ways", the fact that
it is called " evil ways" does not make it a harmful song; on the
contrary, it encourages the person to whom it's directed to change those
evil ways.]

savoy brown - the album hell bound trail pictures a train filled with
and surrounded by demons.

bruce springsteen - his latest single is entitled "i'm on fire".  some
of the lyrics are, "hey little girl is your daddy home./did he go away
and leave you all alone./i got a bad desire, i'm on fire./tell me now
baby is he good to you,/can he do to you the things that i do./at night
i wake up with the sheets soaking wet./only you can co ol my desire, i'm
on fire."  [comment:  i find it disturbing that the song is quoted so
poorly, without ellipsis marks (. . .) to show where lines have been
omitted.  also, for all the concern these people seem to have for the
video representation of a song, i find it significant that in the video
for "i'm on fire", springsteen is shown to be tempted by a beautiful
married woman, and resisting the temptation.  perhaps including such
information in the d escription would have weakened the case that this
artis t's work is "murder music".

rod stewart - he said that he dresses and acts the way he does because
he has to appeal to men in his audience as well as women.  in his song,
"tonight's the night", he asks his angel to "spread her wings so i can
come inside".  one of his songs is entitled, "i'm gonna kill my wife".

styx - their name comes from the mythological river that is supposed to
flow through hell, the river styx.  one of their albums is entitled the
serpent is rising.  [comment:  as a longtime styx fan , i am especially
upset at this denouncement.  first, here is another denouncement that
contains not a single reference to the band's music.  second, if these
people are really concerned with accurately discovering (what they
consider to be) potentially harmful music, they have failed miserably
here; i can think of several styx songs that are fairly explicit with
respect to drug use, sex, and what some people might consider to occult
subjects.  the fact that the band was singled out and attacked because
the y happen to have a name taken from greek mythology is not only
ludicrous but criminally misleading.  finally, i have listened to all of
styx's music over and over.  i have heard every song many times,
including "light up", "snowblind", "you better ask", "grove of
eglantine", "lords of the ring", and "the serpent is rising".  despite
my repeated exposure to sex, drugs, and the occult, i have never smoked
anything, have never worshipped the devil or the forces of evil (nor
have i ever felt any desire to), and i am currently involved in a
monogamous relationship.   by virtue of my prolonged exposure to this
group's music, much of which probably falls under the censors' criticism
for explicit sex, drugs, and occult references, and the total lack of
any negative consequences, i must conclude that the fears of the pmrc
and of freedom village are completely unfounded.  they simply have no
case.]

donna summers - she is in regular tough with her astrologer and arranges
her traveling around the configurations of the h eavens.  sometimes
known as "the first lady of lust", her music is filled with sexual
references.  her first big hit was a 17 minute song entitled "love to
love you, baby", in which she repeated the title over and over and
simulated the sounds of 22 orgasms.  [comments:  i thought donna summer
was a born-again christian?  also, just out of curiosity, does anyone
know what 22 orgasms sound like?)

twisted sister - their album under the blade has a song called "burn in
 hell".  some of the lyrics are, "welcome to the abandoned land,/come on
 in child;/take my hand./here there's no work or play./only one bill to
 pay./there's just five words to say as you go down, down, down.
 chorus:  you're gonna burn in hell/oh, burn in hell."  another song on
 that album is "beast".  they are the self-proclaimed "dirtbags of
 rock".  "he dresses like a supervillain, screams out his lyrics, and
 introduces songs wiht a stream of profanities.  heavy metal is raucous,
 loud, obnoxious, irritat ing . . . it is rebellious . . . there is no
 inbetween."  their lead singer said, "when i am on stage i scream,
 stomp, jump up and down and curse my brains out".  faces of rock
 [comment:  it is generally considered bad practice to use a pronoun,
 such as "he", above, without mentioning the person to whom it refers.
 i assume the reference is to dee snider, twisted sister's lead singer.]

jethro tull - ian anderson, the lead singer, not only plays the flute,
he also uses it for obscene jestures.  in several of his songs, like
aqualung, he attacks go d and christianity.   he told rolling stone, "if
jesus christ came back today, he and i would get into our brown
corduroys and go to the nearest jean store and overturn the racks of
blue denim.  then we'd get crucified in the morning.  one of the group's
songs explaims [sic], "we are our own saviors and if jesus saves he'd
better save himself".  they also say, "in the beginning man created god
. . . "  [comment:  i don't believe, if memory serves me correctly, that
"our father" says "we are our own saviors" .  the song does say, "if
jesus saves, he'd better save himself from the glory glory seekers who
use his name in death" - indicating, in conjunction with the rest of the
song, that religion has been corrupted and perverted by greed and
power-hunger.  if organizations are concerned about bad influences on
this country's children, they would do well to investigate public
schools and church youth groups, since these harbor many bad influences
on young people, mostly i n the form of peers and classmates.]

tina turner - rolling stone states, "tina turner is loose".  her album
private dancer includes a song called "what's love got to do with it?"
her dress is vulgar and her songs promote "free sex" and lust.

the undisputed truth - this group has an album out whose cover shows a
demon hanging on the cross of jesus christ.

uriah heep - their album the magician's birthday has many occult
references.  demons and wizards is another of their albums which
features several satanic songs, such as "travelers in time", abo ut
astral projection or out of the body experiences.

van haven [sic] - this is another very vulgar group.  even their album
 covers show scenes of lewdness (like obscene jestures [sic] with a
 microphone).  an interviewer for rollin stone [sic] magazine traveled
 with the group for several days and later commented, "i've seen enough
 nude women and heard enough abasive language and morning-after
 anecdotes to fuel an article about porn-rock".  david lee roth, the
 lead singer, said, "whatever your sexual ideals, whatever somebody else
 can't do in his 9 to 5 job, i can do in rock and roll.  i'm giving our
 daily lives melodies, beats and titles".  it is reported that roth has
 taken out paternity insurance to protect against women suing him for
 child support.  one album includes the songs, "on fire" and "running
 with the devil".  [comment:  in reference to the song "on fire", which
 i don't believe i've ever heard:  the use of the word "fire" in a song
 title does not n ecessarily indicate that the song has occult refer
 ences or is, even by these people's standards, potentially harmful.]

venom - a group that brags about its satanic existence.  blasphemy,
demon possession, and satan worship are all rolled into one song that
contains the following words, "without any fear of god/we're possessed
by all that is evil./the death of you, god, we demand./we spit at the
virgin you worship/and sit at lord satan's left hand."

the village people - jaques morali, the manager of this group of 5 gays
and one straight, said that he form ed the group as a protest against
anita bryant and declared, "i am sincerely trying to produce songs to
make the gay people more acceptable".  songs inclue "y.m.c.a.", which
talks about "hanging out with all the boys" and finding many good ways
to have fun.  "cruising" is taken from the practice of homosexuals
driving around attempting to pick up other homosexuals.  [comment:
while not familiar with most of this group's music, i am amused (and
disturbed) that none of the quotes given here include any refer ence to
anything harmful to young people.  accepting homosexuals into society is
not tantamount to becoming homosexual, nor even to approving of their
sexual preferences (i have many friends who, with varying degrees of
frequency, do things i don't like).  also, according to a good friend of
mine who happens to be gay, "cruising" doesn't usually involve driving
around, but rather refers to eying other patrons of a bar.]

w.a.s.p. - "we are sexual perverts" is what w.a.s.p. stands for.  chris
holmes, their l ead vocalist, posed nude for hustler magazine.  their
first single, animal ("f*** like a beast") was banned on 80 percent of
the british radio stations.  many stations around the country have
banned their records and many countries around the world have banned
their concerts.  onstage antics include the staged torture of a woman on
a rack, the drinking of blood from a skull and throwing raw meat into
the audience.  when newspapers in britain wrote about them, group member
blackie lawless com mented, "i dont' knwo if you saw any of the news
clippings that came out of there, (britain), but if you had you would've
thought the devil himself had come to britain".

wayne county - an admitted homosexual, he declares, "i always wanted to
be homecoming queen.  i was such an unlucky girl".  his songs include,
"it takes a man like me to like a woman like me".

white witch - the cover of their album is in the shape of an ankh, and
the concept of "white magic" is false, for it is all founded in the
occult.  even anton lave y, the priest of the first church of satan in
california said, "call it black, call it white, call it what you will,
it's all evil, and it all gets its power from the source of hell".

the who - they are followers of eastern mysticism and the teachings of
meher baba, a guru.  townsend put out a solo album dedicated to baba and
included a hindu prayer.  peter declared, "baba is christ".  the group
is famous for the production of "tommy", which was a filthy blasphemy
against christianity.  keith moon, of the group, was known to have
exposed himself publicly and to have had his living room littered with
human excrement.  his life ended with an overdose of drugs.  [comment:
regardless of how the opera and the individual songs were intended, i
always took the last movement, "see me, feel me/listening to you" to be
homage to god, and that was how i interpreted it.]

stevie wonder - he released the album songs in the key of life  to
correspond with his astrological charts.  the cover of inner visions
depicts the sy mbol of astral projection.  in the song "jesus children
of america", he puts down christ and christianity.  he says that
"transcendental meditation speaks of peace of mind".  [comment:  one
man's statement that a discipline or religion speaks of peace of mind
does not mean that it grants such peace, or even that the individual has
found such peace through the discipline, but merely that it speaks of
peace of mind.]

yes - the album tales from topographic oceans is supposed to reveal the
science of god, cert ain sexual rituals and reincarnation.  the album
jacket explains that the lyrics are based on hindu scripture.

a collection of comments by kristi wachter (otherwise known as the
person who typed all this information into computer-readable files)

there are a few points made elsewhere in these files that i'd like to
summarize and emphasize.

1.  a great deal of the outcry over rock music has to do with religious
content.  by law, church and state are separate; no organization or
government body has the righ t to dictate personal spiritual beliefs to
anyone (to my knowledge, minors have the same rights in this area as
everyone else).  as you may have noticed, many of the complaints and
accusations refer to satanic, occult, supernatural, or un-christian
(i.e. hindu or buddhist) content.  as regards occult and supernatural
content, i find yet another inconsistency with these organizations,
since they have not complained about amy grant or andre crouch albums,
even though their music h as to do with supernatural ma tters (the
difference being that they take their inspiration from the
judeo-christian god, a religious choice which is currently considered
acceptable by most of western society).  as for the "occult" label, that
would seem to include christian music as well; my dictionary defines
"occult" as 1.  not revealed, secret; 2.  abstruse, mysterious; 3.  of
or relating to supernatural agencies, their effects, or knowledge of
them [the merriam-webster dictiona ry].  in other words, occult matters
are supernatural ma tters, which are otherworldly matters (whether
heavenly or hellish).  the attempts of these organizations or any others
to ban, label, or in any way restrict music because of the religious
nature of its lyrics must not be tolerated.

2.  there is no evidence that exposure, even prolonged exposure, to
words or ideas will have any influence, whether favorable or negative,
on the listener.  on the other hand, there is considerable evidence that
people can listen to rock music for years without any adverse effe cts.
i, for one, have listened to pop and rock music unwaveringly since i was
five - that's three-quarters of my life - with no adverse effects.  i am
not a sex-crazed, drugged-out, devil-worshipping maniac.  quite the
contrary:  i am involved in a monogamous relationship, i have never
smoked anything, nor indulged in any illegal drugs (other than some
alcohol before i was of age), and i have never worshipped any god other
than the judeo-ch ristian god, nor have i ever felt any desire to.  i
have found stre ngth, joy, and pleasure in music; rock music has
enriched me rather than harming me. (one further note:  a
much-publicized study recently disproved the public's fears that
birth-control information would cause young people to become more
sexually active.  the researchers found that the teenagers who received
birth control information lost their virginity at a later age and had
fewer pregnancies than the group without such information.)

3.  these ratings are not like movie ratings in two important ways.  fi
rst, instead of a gradient (i.e. g, pg, pg-13, r, and x), the pmrc
demanded specific labels (i.e. s for sex, v for violence, o for occult,
and d/a for drugs and alcohol).  second, recording artists are closely
associated with their work, whereas actors are considered to be
"pretending" and if, for example, an actor portrays a mass murderer, he
is exposed to much less criticism than a musician who writes about mass
murder (thanks to fran k zappa for pointing that out).

organizations like the pmrc and freedom village have no case.  there
 simply is no evidence that rock music or any other kind of music can
 harm a young person.

 in all honesty, i must admit that if i had children, i would very
likely be uncomfortable to find them listening to certain extremes of
music.  however, i would continue to fight the censorship efforts of
such organizations for two reasons.  first, i would want to base my
judgments regarding my children's listening habits (and my own) on my
own values, not on anyone else's.  second, i bel ieve that the best way
to combat whatever potential harm may lie in song lyrics is by educating
kids and discussing with them what they're listening to.  forbidding
them from listening to something will not protect them from other
songs/tv programs/influences of which i was not aware.

lastly, i would like to mention that many of the influences considered
harmful come from many other sources.  during the pmrc hearing, one of
the senators mentioned that studded leather wristbands, weapons, and
leather harnes ses were being produced in children's sizes and offered
to children through advertisements in comic strips.  the senator took
this as evidence that five and ten year olds were becoming warped by
listening to sado-masochistic lyrics in rock songs.  a few weeks after
the hearing, i was visiting some friends, and their five-year-old boy
was wearing one of the studded leather wristbands.  i asked where he got
it and was not very surprised to hear that it was part of his
fascination with conan the barbarian (not only a movie, but also a very
successful television cartoon and a complete collection of toys and
accessories).  whether or not these things can really harm children
should be left to the parents' discretion.  i am quite confident from
the information i have, however, that organizations like the pmrc and
freedom village cannot help parents to make informed decisions, but will
only disseminate misinformation and breed more prejudice and ignorance.

essay

william safire

sink the clipper chip

washington

well-meaning law and intelligence officials, vainly seeking to maintain
their vanishing ability to eavesdrop, have come up with a scheme that
endangers the personal freedom of every american.

nobody doubts that f.b.i. wiretaps help catch crooks or that the national
security agency's "big ears" alert us to the plans of terrorists.  and
nobody can deny that new technology makes it easier for the bad guys to
encode their communications to avoid the eavesdropping of the good guys.

but the solution that faceless clinton officials are putting forward shows
outdated law enforcement rooted in abysmal understanding of the 
information explosion.

the clinton notion, recycled from an aborted bush idea, is to put the same
encryption chip; in every telephone and computer made in the u.s.  this
new encoding device, or scrambler, would help you and me protect the
privacy of our conversations and messages and bank accounts from each 
other.  that sounds great, but here comes the catch:  the federal 
government would know and be able to use the code numbers to wiretap each 
of us.

to the tune of "i got algorithm," the eavesdrop establishment is singing 
that it will help us protect our privacy --- but not from intrusion by the 
feds. in effect, its proposal demands we turn over to washington a 
duplicate set of keys to our homes, formerly our castles, where not even 
the king in olden times could go.

the "clipper chip" --- aptly named, as it clips the wings of individual
liberty --- would encode, for federal perusal whenever a judge rubber-
stamped a warrant, everything we say on a phone, everything we write on a
computer, every order we give to a shopping network or bank or 800 or 900
number, every electronic note we leave our spouses or dictate to our
personal-digit-assistant genies.

add to that stack of intimate date the medical information derived from
the national "health security card" mr. clinton proposes we all carry.
combine it with the travel, shopping and credit data available from all
our plastic cards, along with psychological and student test scores.
throw in the confidential tax returns, sealed divorce proceedings, welfare
records, field investigations for job applications, raw files and c.i.a.
dossiers available to the feds, and you have the individual citizen
standing naked to the nosy bureaucrat.

assure us not that our personal life stories will be "safeguarded" by
multiple escrows in the brave new world of snooperware; we saw only last
month how political appointees can rifle the old-fashioned files of
candidates and get off scot-free.  whenever personal information is
amassed and readily available, it will be examined by the curious, and if
it is valuable, it will be stolen by political hackers.

ah, but wouldn't it be helpful to society to have instant access to the
encoded communications of a mafia capo, or a terrorist ordering the
blow-up of a skyscraper, or a banker financing a dictator's nuclear
development?

sure it would.  that's why no self-respecting vice overlord or terrorist 
or local drug-runner would buy or use clipper-chipped american
telecommunications equipment.  they would buy non-american hardware with
unmonitored japanese or german or indian encryption chips and laugh all
the way to the plutonium factory.

the only people tap-able by american agents would be honest americans ---
or those crooked americans dopey enough to buy american equipment with the
pre-compromised american code.  subsequent laws to mandate the f.b.i.
bug in every transmitter would be as effective as today's laws banning
radar detectors.

tomorrow's law enforcement and espionage cannot be planned by people stuck
in the wiretap and big ear mind-set of the past.  the new ultra secret
is that the paradigm has shifted; encryption has overcome decryption.

billions now spent on passive technical surveillance must be shifted to
active means of learning criminal or aggressive plans.  human informers
must be recruited or placed, as "sigint" declines and "humint" rises in
the new era; psychic as well as monetary rewards for ratting must be
raised; governments must collude closely to trace transfers of wealth.

cash in your clipper chips, wiretappers:  you can't detect the crime wave
of the future with those old earphones on.

opening letter


dear friend,

here is the package we have prepared to assist you in any local effort
you care to initiate in opposition the [sic] the wives of big brother
and their dangerous program.

included is the typical pmrc fund-raising letter.  we want you to see
for yourselves what their pitch is.  if you agree with their point of
view, do what their letter tells you to do. if you don't, use the
addresses they have provided (people to complain to), and, instead of
complaining, encourage them to broadcast things t hat you like.  if they
are not broadcasting enough of what you like, tell them what your
entertainment preferences are, and demand more of it [sic].  if you
don't make your feelings known, you are going to be stuck with watching
and listening to the stuff they like.

also included is a copy of my letter to the president and my cashbox
editorial.  feel free to quote any of this material in letters you might
write to your elected represent atives.

the pmrc has a lot of nerve to ask for money...they are alread y very
well funded, well connected, and seem to have the entire u.s. news media
in their back pocket.  this mailing, all legal fees, phone bills and
travel costs connected with fighting this issue have been paid for out
of profits from barking pumpkin record sales, and from barfko-swill mail
order funds.  we thank you for buying these items.  without the orders
you have already placed, a real opposing view to this issue would never
have been heard.

okay...it's up to you now. don't let yourselves down.. tak e some time
and help protect your constitutional rights.  you know how to use a
phone.  you know how to write letters.  make some noise about this
issue.  use your imagination. don't bend over for the wives of big
brother.

"extortion, pure and simple..." an open letter to the music industry by
frank zappa

with all due respect to stan gortikov and the riaa, i would like a few
moments of your time to express my personal feelings regarding the
unfortunate decision to bend over for the pmrc on the issue of album
'identification'.

first, let me say that i appreciate the difficult position the riaa is
in, and sympathize fully with the organization struggle to move
legislation through congress.  the problem seems to be the thurmond
committee.  this is where the industry's proposed legislation will live
or d ie.  it is no secret that mrs. thurmond is a member of pmrc.  what
is apparently happening is a case of extortion, pure and simple:  the
riaa must tap dance for these washington wives or the industry's bill
will feel the wrath of their famous husbands.

it is to the riaa's credit that the bulk of pmrc's demands were
rejected, however capitulation on the stickering issue will cause more
problems than it will solve.

the pmrc makes no secret of its intentions to use 'special relatio
nships' to force this issue .  in an interview on an albany radio
station, mrs. pam howar made reference to a mr. fowler at the fcc,
suggesting that some intervention by this agency might be in order,
should the pmrc's other nefarious techniques fail.  did somebody rewrite
the fcc charter while we weren't looking?  what's going on here?

these cultural terrorists are attempting to create a hostage situation.
it is time to bring in the delta force...with a friendly reminder that
extortion i s still an illegal act, that conspiracy to co mmit extortion
is an illegal act, and that this issue goes beyond first amendment
considerations.  we are witnessing a type of corrupt practice that must
end.  no person married or related to a government official should be
permitted to waste the nation's time on ill-conceived housewife hobby
projects such as this.

the pmrc's case is totally without merit, based on a hodge-podge of
fundamentalist frogwash and illogical conclusions.  sh rieking in terror
at the thought of someone hearing references to mastur bation on a
prince record, the pmrc's members put on their 'guardian of the people'
costumes and the media comes running.  it is an unfortunate trend of the
'80's that the slightest murmur from a special interest group
(especially when it has friends in high places) causes a knee-jerk
reaction of appeasement from a wide range of industries that ought to
know better.

if you are an artist reading this, think for a moment...did anyone ask
you if you wanted to have the stigma of 'p otential filth' plopped onto
your next release via this 'appeasement sticker?'  if you are a
songwriter, did anyone ask you if you wanted to spend the rest of your
career modifying your lyric content to suit the spiritual needs of an
imaginary eleven-year-old?

the answer is, obviously, no.  in all of this, the main concern has been
the business agenda of the major labels versus the egos and sexual
neuroses of these vigilant ladies.

a record company has the right to conduct its business and to make a
profit, but not at the expense of the people who make the product
possible...someone still has to write and perform the music.  the riaa
has taken what i feel to be a short-sighted approach to the issue.  the
'voluntary sticker' will not appease these creatures, nor will it grease
the chute through the thurmond committee.  there are no promises or
guarantees here; only threats and insinuations from pmrc.

the riaa has shown a certain disregard for the creative people of the
industry in its eagerness to protect the revenues of the record com
panies.  ladies and gentlemen, we are all in this together...when you
watched the hostages on tv, didn't you sort of mumble to yourself,
"let's nuke 'em...?"  the pmrc deserves nothing less (and the same to
nmrc or any other censorship group with a broadcast blacklist in its
back pocket).

for the elected officials who sit idly by while their spouses run rabid
with anti-sexual pseudo-christian legislative fervor, there lurks the
potential for the same sort of dumb emba rrassment caused by billy
carter's fasc inating exploits.  i do not deny anyone the right to their
opinions on any matter...but when certain people's opinions have the
potential to influence my life, and the lives of my children because of
their special access to legislative machinery, i think it raises
important questions of law.  ronald reagan came to office with the
proclaimed intention of getting the federal government off our backs.
the secret agenda seems to be not to remove it , but to force certain
people to wear it like a lampshade at a d.c. tupperware party.

nobody looks good wearing brown lipstick.  these creatures can hurt you.
their ignorance is like a virus.  get mad.  fight back.  the goldwater
committee is hearing this matter on september 19.  use the phone.  use
the telex.  demand that congress deal with the substantive issue of
connubial 'insider trading' and power-brokerage.  demand censure for
those elected officials who participate.  demand fairness for the record
industry's legislation in the thurmond committe e.  remind them that
they have a duty to the people who elected them that takes priority over
their domestic relationships.

article from the los angeles times, october 24, 1985 zappa takes on the
u.s. senate in 'porn wars' by rip rense

guess who "sings" on frank zappa's soon-to-be-released "porn wars"
recording?

none other than seven members of the u.s. senate, including sen. paula
hawkins (r-fla.), sen. ernest (fritz) hollings (d-s.c.) and sen. albert
a. gore jr. (d-tenn.).

zappa has woven statements made by these of ficials at the sept. 19
senate commerce committee hearing on so-called "porn rock" lyrics into a
provocative 12-minute track that will appear on his upcoming "frank
zappa vs. the mothers of prevention" album.

"you testify before one of those senate hearings and see how arrogant
they are and what relative position they think they hold in the
universe," zappa said in the recording studio of his laurel canyon home.

"they have blown themselves out of proportion to reality.  there are a
couple that ar e ok...bu t there's no way i could have just walked away
from washington, d.c., and just laughed it off.  it's too depressing."

the avant-garde "porn wars" is an ambitious collage that blends
electronic music and statements actually made to the committee and to
zappa, who testified against the parents music resource center's
campaign against sex, violence and drug references in rock music.

in the record, you hear:

--sen. hawkins endlessly repeating the phrase, "fire and chains and ot
her objectionable tools of grat ification in some twisted minds."

--sen. hollings saying, "outrageous filth" and "maybe i could make a
good rock star, i don't know."

--sen. paul s. trible jr. (r-va.) chanting the word, "rape."

--the rev. jeff ling, consultant to the parents resource group, quoting
"offensive" lyrics from an lp by the mentors.  among the phrases:  "i
will drive my love into you."

the irony of the song--which will be released nov. 15 on zappa's barking
pumpkin labe l--is that officials who oppose what they consider obsce ne
or pornographic images in rock find themselves describing many of those
very images on a rock lp.

poetic justice? sweet revenge?

neither, according to zappa; it's just art.

"there are aspects of phase music employed (on the record)...it uses
musique concrete techniques.  it's kind of like a cubistic portrait of
congress at work...'congress descending a staircase.'"

the new track, which isn't likely to get much airplay because of its use
of four-letter words, begins with preliminary co mments from sen ators
and then seems to break away dramatically into a series of voices
swirling, growling, chattering, chanting and wailing.

after a pastiche of hollings arpeggios and trible trills, there is an
abrupt quotation that was initially recorded for "lumpy gravy," zappa's
1968 ballet:  "this must be the end of the world.  all the people (are)
turning into pigs and ponies.  i can't let it happen to me."

in reply to a senator's question about why the hearings are being held,
zappa's disfigured voice chants "sex. ..sex...sex," while ling--again
reading a mentors lyric--declares, "listen, you little slut."

one of the hearing's most celebrated moments--an exchange between zappa
and hawkins over what kind of toys zappa buys for his kids--is saluted
in the recording, as well as a compliment to the rock musician by
democrat gore of tennessee, "i respect you as a true original and as a
tremendously talented musician." the latter is punctuated by
hollings--at near-chipmunk tone--repeating the line about his becomin g
a ro ck star.

the work concludes with hollings' apparent aside into the open
microphone at the end of zappa's appearance:  "we haven't got 'em
whipped on this one yet.  we've got a bear by the tail here..."  the
remarks are followed by ominous, fading chords.

are there any legal problems in using the voices?

presumably not, according to zappa.  he said, smiling, "you bet i called
a lawyer on it."

the founder of the mothers of invention said he is also producing an
hourlong v ideo for home use covering key mom ents in the hearings.

on "porn wars," zappa programmed the voices into a digital computer
system keyboard, which allowed him to "play" the voices in registers
ranging from "gorilla" to "munchkin" to "mega-chipmunk" to "mosquito."

does he think the humorous recording unfairly satirizes the senators'
views?

"not at all," he said, without reservation.  "you could (just read their
remarks in) the congressional record and have gotten the same charge. i
just did a little grunt work to dig up some of the more amusing lines
and stick them in a package that will hopefully make sense to a
rock'n'roll consumer, and maybe make them concerned about what kind of
people there are in washington."

he chuckled.

"hmm. maybe a better name would be 'congress eats the young.'"

pennsylvania avenue washington, d.c.  20500

mr. president,

even though i disagree strongly with man y administration policies, i
have never doubted your personal views on basic constitutional issues
are sincere.

i would like to know your opinion of the record censorship program
sponsored by the pmrc, an organization involving the wives of elected
governmental officials.  do you asupport [sic] this effort?  if so, have
you considered the basic issue of fairness when a pet project, likely to
result in legislative action that will restrain trade and affect the
lives of millions of americans, is promoted by the spouse of an elected
official and rushed to a senate hearing while important national
business waits in the wings?  is it fair that people not fortunate
enough to be married to a d.c. superstar have to keep their mouths shut
while 'the washington wives' diddle with the legislative machinery?

the pmrc is an unlicensed lobbying group, comporting itself
outrageously.  while threatening an entire industry with the wrath of
their husbands' powerful c ommittees, they blithely spew frogwash and
innuendo with t he assistance of an utterly captivated media.  when the
pmrc's proposal leaps to a full committee hearing september 19th, an
unfortunate precedent will be set.

if you support the pmrc (or the nmrc or any other fundamentalist
pressure groups) in their efforts to perpetuate the myth that sex equals
sin, you will help to institutionalize the neurotic misconception that
keeps pornographers in business.

by attempting to remove all references to sexuality from media consumed
by young people, the pmrc, contrary to its stated goals, will create an
atmosphere of ignorance that benefits the child molester, not the child.

in a nation where deranged pressure groups fight for the removal of
sexual education from public schools, and parents know so little about
sex that they have to call dr. ruth on tv for answers to rudimentary
anatomical questions, it would seem infinitely more responsible for
these esteemed wives and mothers to demand a full-scale congressional
demys tification of the subject.

are we headed toward a time when descriptions of sexual behavior in
entertainment media can be obtained only by employing a lawyer to
petition under the freedom of information act?  must all sexual
practices in the united states be tested and approved by the moral
majority?  when they test them, do we get to watch?

assuming, for argument's sake, that the basic premise of the pmrc's
effort is to shield people in a certain age bracket from exposure to
various f orms of undesirable information, the proposition is grossly
inequitable since it singles out rock music as the villain.

country music contains references to sex, violence, alcohol and the
devil, yet the pmrc is not requesting a warning label on these records.
could it be that a certain senatorial husband and wife team from
tennessee has concocted this issue as an affirmative action program to
benefit the suffering multitudes in nashville?  surely there are other
ways to protect this vital source of tennessee state revenue.

is there anyone in the pmrc who can differentiate i nfallibly between
rock and country music?  artists in both fields have crossed stylistic
lines, even within an individual album.  if an album is part rock, part
country, what sort of label does it get?  is this determination to be
made according to the state in which the material was recorded?

the pmrc wants ratings to start as of the date of their enactment.  what
will be the status of those recordings remaining from the golden era
prior to censorship?  do they become collector's items...or will the
gover nment order them burned in a public ceremony, somewhere in
virginia?

if, as they suggest, hearing a certain type of music can cause unwanted
behavior, then anyone who has heard a beatles or a beachboys record is
in danger.  those were charles manson's favorite groups.

wagner's influence on hitler is well documented.  shouldn't the pmrc
consider a big red "m" for those classical works favored by
megalomaniacs?  what if statistics become available showing a marked
preference for wayne newton and barry manil ow among convicted
white-collar felons?

fundamentalist christianity is not a state religion.  the pmrc's request
for labels regarding sexually explicit lyrics, violence, drugs, alcohol,
and occult content reads like a catalog of phenomena abhorrent to
practitioners of that faith.  is the pmrc aware of the muslim
affiliations of some black performers?  if they should suddenly decide
to record lyrics advocating the violent overthrow of america in the name
of allah, will the pmrc's labels deter a nation of se mi-literates from
learning an exciting new dance called 'the funky jihad'?  will the pmrc
wish they had used the big red "m" to warn of muslim content?

the establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, sets the
stage for an endless series of 'control programs' based on 'things
certain christians don't like'.  what if the next bunch of washington
wives demands a large yellow "j" on all material written or performed by
jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to 'concealed zio
nist d octrine'?  how long will it take till somebody else's wife
demands that composers and performers wear a special arm band at all
times in public, reflecting the stigma of their category rating?

the pmrc has demanded that the record companies 'reassess' the contracts
of those groups who do things on stage that they don't approve of.
groups are comprised of individuals.  if one guy wiggles too much, does
the whole band get an "x"?  if the group gets dropped from the label
because of the "x", do the other guy s in the group who weren't wiggling
get to sue the guy who wiggled because he ruined their careers?

should the individual musicians be rated?  if so, who is qualified to
determine if the bass player behaves like an "o", the guitar player
behaves like an "x", the vocalist behaves like a "d/a", or the drummer
behaves like a "v"?  will unscrupulous performers voluntarily rate
themselves "b/a" (born again), in order to protect their careers and
differentiate themselve s from the rest of the stigmatized scum whe n
they shoot the next "let's go pretend to feed somebody" video?

it was a sad day for composers, performers and record retailers when the
major labels agreed to the first of pmrc's absurd demands.

why did they agree?  the record industry bills (h.r. 3163 and h.r. 2911)
regarding tape royalties and piracy must pass through senator thurmond's
committee.  with mrs. thurmond a member of pmrc, the industry was hardly
in a position to express their true feelings on the matter. after broad
hints of 'legislative strangulation', the major labels attempted a
comprise.  "not good enough!" said the washington wives, pressing for
legislation to control "satanistic or occult content".

a composer or performer stigmatized by the "o" rating winds up on the
ultimate blacklist.  all it might take is a song with a reference to
someone's astrological sign.  what legal hazards lurk then for the
unfortunate retailer who sells "o" rated records?  if he sells one to
somebody he's not supposed to, does he get the red-hot tweezers or what?

the pmrc's program protects country musicians, not children.  it is
mechanically unworkable from a listening/rating standpoint, considering
the quantity of recorded material released each year.  if enacted,
american musical culture will become a hostage in the beige zone,
somewhere between the salem witchcraft trials and the mccarthy era.

facts make bad law, and people who write bad laws are, in my opinion,
more dangerous than songwr iters who celebrate sexuality.  the facts
simply do not support the pmrc's outlandish claims.  this is more than a
first amendment issue.  freedom of religious thought (if this matter
produces legislation determining what is 'occult'), the right to
assemble (if these idiotic ratings extend to live concerts), and the
right to due process for composers, performers and retailers (if the
major labels proceed with 'album identification', in violation of
existing contracts) are all jeopardized by pmrc's demands.

i submit that elected officials hav e a spiritual and fiduciary duty to
their constituents that takes precedent over the whims of their spouses.
how many other costly and ill-conceived governmental programs have been
generated in this manner and dumped onto the shoulders of american
business?

those involved in this sort of 'connubial insider trading', if not
subject to prosecution under existing law, ought to be disciplined by
their peers...or perhaps they should take their own medicine and
voluntarily rate themse lves.  it shouldn't be too hard to determine who
deserv es the congressional "x", the congressional ?d/a", or the
congressional "v".  it's hard to imagine a congressional "o", but there
must be a few on somebody's committee.

the pmrc loudly decries the label of censorship when it is applied to
their plan.  jesse jackson reminded jerry falwell in a recent cnn debate
that "you do not judge a tree by the bark it wears, but by the fruit it
bears..."

mr. president, if you are not serious about getting government off our
backs, could you at leas t do something about getting it out of our
nostrils?  there seems to be a lethal cloud of brimstone and mildewed
bunting rising form the senate floor.

i do not expect a reply to this letter, however, any public statement
from you on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

thank you,

it's not over yet, folks by frank zappa

okay...the 'hearing' is over...you think it's all going to fade into the
sunset now, right?  not quite.  the good news is the pmrc has given up o
n all demands except that som e kind of symbol appears on the front of
an album with 'undesirable content'. that's right.  just a 'tiny little
symbol' on the front.  is this too much to ask?  you bet it is!

that 'tiny little symbol' still requires somebody else to decide what
those lyrics mean, and whether or not they are 'filthy'.  this
determination is the responsibility of individual parents making
decisions based on standards in their community, not those of a record
executi ve in new york or hollywood.

most of you did not see or hear what really happened during the
'hearing'.  there was quite a bit of 'news management' taking place,
especially regarding my testimony.  cnn viewers saw only the
semi-apoplectic senator gorton denouncing me for my 'constitutional
ignorance'.

under the 'hearing' rules, i was not allowed to say anything in
response, however, i would like to take this opportunity to remind him
that although i flunked just about everything else in high school, i did
get an "a" in civics, and secondly, if he wan ted to tell me i was just
an ignorant musician, why didn't he use the koppel method and say, "now,
mr. zappa, you're an intelligent man..."  anybody who gets that
recitation from ted twice in one episode of nightline has surely been
told how stupid he is.

since the media coverage was enormous, including foreign press, i began
my testimony with a 'reference reading' of the first amendment so that
people outside the u.s. might understand what we were discussing, and to
remind vermin like senator gorton that, in spite o f their bizarre
interpretation, this 'historical document' was still in existence.  the
'hearing' lasted about 5 hours.  the 'denouncement' was the only thing
offered by gorton during the whole event.  no questions.  no debate.
just a photo opportunity for another congressional bozo.

since my written speech would have lasted longer than the 10 minutes i
was allotted, i read a short version.  the full version prepared
testimony. after reading it, i propos ed a solution to the whole matter,
based on a sugge stion from my attorney, larry stein.  senator hollings
(the one who said "if i could do away with all of this music
constitutionally, i would ...") said, in the hearing, on the record,
that he preferred my proposal to the pmrc rating idea.  you never heard
about it, did you?

this revolutionary proposal is very simple.  no rating.  no sticker.  no
committee decisions.  let the parent decide after reading the lyrics.
the lyrics would be printed on a sheet of white paper (preferably with a
first amendm ent re minder at the top of the page), under the
shrink-wrap on the back of the album.  for cassettes, an accordion-fold.
since they asked for it, we'll let the pmrc figure out how to pay for
it.  the royalties to writers and publishers must be paid at the
statutory rate.  the cost of printing must be paid.  once the album
leaves the store with this information on it, you can't bring it back.

any kind of warning system is going to cost money.  this one puts the
responsibili ty for the decision of what is clean or dirty where it
belongs:  in the hands of the parents.  if millions of parents really
want this, then funding it should not be a problem.  if not:  most
record stores still have a children's section.  you can always shop
there. article from billboard dated feb. 15, 1986

maryland assembly mulls bill on record obscenity

by bill holland

annapolis, md.  the maryland state assembly is considering a bill that
would make it a crime - punishable by fine or jail term - for a retailer
to sell an audio recording co ntaining obscene lyrics to a minor.

should the measure become law - and sources say it has a good chance -
it would become the first obscenity law in the country to prohibit the
sale of state-defined x-rated records and audio tapes to minors.

the measure, an amendment to a long-standing maryland law forbidding the
sale of obscene books, magazines and, more recently, videocassettes to
persons under 18, was introduced last month by democratic delegate
judith toth.  toth represents both rural an d affluent su burban
constituents in upper montgomery county.

the bill has already gone through a jan. 14 hearing. no one spoke in
opposition, and area dealers say they did not learn about the hearing
until afterwards.

"dealers have called me and said, 'hey, what's going on here, i could go
to jail'," says toth.  "i tell them, 'that's right, you could go to
jail'."

a spokesman for the national assn. of recording merchandisers (narm)
says that the hearing also caught them by surp rise, although the group
has since sent out both a mailgram and a letter explaining the content
of the bill to area members.

toth is not sympathetic to dealer alarm.  "there's no excuse for their
lobbyists not picking this up," she says.  "they're paid very well to
monitor these things.  we notified the press several times about the
hearing."

asked if she made any direct contact with maryland dealers and
distributors to invite them to the hearing, she answered, "we're not
under a ny obligation to let our opponents know."

the measure, h.b. 111, is "high on the voting list" in the house
judiciary committee, and committee vote is expected on the measure by
the middle of this week.  if it passes, it will go to the floor of the
house, and then to the senate side for a hearing in march.  because of
the 90-day maryland session schedule, the bill will have to be voted on
by april 7.

while some industry sources say that chance of passage is not at all
assured, others point to toth's success in getting a similar amendment
passed in the 1984 session which imposes a maximum first-time fine of
$1,000 and jail term of one year to any dealer who rents or sells an
x-rated video to a minor.

toth says she received a packet of material, including offensive song
lyrics, from the parents music resource center (pmrc), the
headline-making mothers' group that negotiated a compromise agreement on
the issue of controversial lyrics with recording industry assn. of
america (riaa) member companies last fall (billboard, nov. 9). she then
too k the package around to other mem bers.  "i didn't even xerox that
stuff," she says.

she and her staff have also visited several area record stores.  "they
told us, 'hey, we don't carry that kind of stuff,' but we went down the
line with them and there they were," she says.  she mentions albums by
twisted sister, marvin gaye, w.a.s.p. and the tubes as examples.

toth says the purpose of the measure is not to go after dealers.  "we're
not going to waste our time going after some little dealer; we'd go
after the manufacturer to keep up their agreement [with the pmrc] and to
make sure that such material is clearly labeled."

she says that "maryland has a fairly liberal court system, and something
would have to be grossly objectionable - a clear-cut case - for the
state's attorney to step in."

local dealer reaction was angry.  "it's ludicrous," says howard
applebaum, owner of the kemp mill records chain, which has 15 stores in
maryland. "obscenity by whose standards?  i'm not prepared to be the
arbiter of what's obscene or not."  appl ebaum say s he is going to call
toth's office and talk over the content of the bill, and will call other
local chain owners.

david blaine, general manager of waxie maxie's, with 13 maryland
outlets, says the bill misses the mark:  "retailers are not the arbiters
of public taste."

senior narm officials were attending a seminar in los angeles and could
not be reached for comment.

the bill would amend article 27, section 419 of the maryland state code
to make it illegal to rent , sell or otherwise disseminate obscene
material relating to phonograph recordings, magnetic tape, cds and laser
disks to anyone under the age of 18.

penalties for first-time offenders could be as high as $1,000 or one
year in jail; repeat offenders could face a $5,000 fine or three years
in jail.

executives of several smaller chains say they didn't even know about the
existence of the proposal. "this is the first i've heard of it," says
page wiencek, owner of penguin feather, a virgin ia- and
washington-based outfit with three maryland stores.

pmrc takes 'porn rock' slide show on the road

by henry schipper

the parents music resource center, which last year wrested a "porn rock"
record labeling agreement from the major diskeries, is still intact and
active.  indeed, instead of resting on its laurels and closing shop, the
group has quietly set about pursuing a grass-roots campaign to alert
localities nation-wide of the allegedly pornographic dangers of rock.

in place of a h igh-profile media -intensive effort, which climaxed last
september in congressional hearings on the subject, the pmrc has been
sending speakers, armed with an up-to-date "porn rock" slide show, to
parents groups around the country.

thus far, the pmrc has been receiving approximately 20-25 requests a
week for its speaker/show, but those requests - and the pmrc's overall
campaign - could intensify greatly as the group tries to work its way
into the 24,000 branch network of t he parents teachers association.

the pta, main ally of the pmrc in last year's labeling fight, has agreed
to cooperate with the latter group in its "educational" drive.  pta
president ann kahn recently met with pmrc leaders and subsequently sent
a letter to the 50 pta state chapters asking them to tell all local ptas
that the pmrc slide show is "available without cost . . . to any pta
council which requests (it)."

a second letter, this one sent to the pta's vast network of local
branches, will inform them directly of the pmrc's "continuous awaren ess
progra m," a pta spokesperson said. second mailing is set for march.

"we're working in conjunction with the pta, trying to get a system where
the slide show will be available all over the country," susan baker,
founding member of the pmrc and wife of treasury secretary james baker,
told daily variety.

"that's how we hope to get the slide show around.  the pta has 5,600,000
members, and there's a real interest and commitment on their part that
parents be aware."

only hitch i n the widescale pta-pmrc program is f unding, with money
for reproduction of the slide show and traveling expenses as yet
uncertain, baker said.

according to baker, pmrc's ongoing efforts are aimed at educating
parents about the "violent and explicit lyrics in rock music," and
building a ground-up movement to pressure record companies, radio
stations, artists and corporate sponsors to create, sell and support
inoffensive product.

"we're trying to activate 'em (the parents).  we're te lling them to
listen to rock stations in cars when they driv e and if they hear
something offensive, to call the stations.  this needs to be done on a
grassroots level," baker said.

one apparently direct result of the pmrc's ongoing efforts is the recent
introduction in the maryland senate of a bill that would make it a crime
to sell state-defined x-rated records to a minor (daily variety, feb.
11).  bill was introduced last month by democratic delegate judith toth
after she received a packet of material, including allegedly porn
lyrics, from the pmrc .

latest updat e of the pmrc slide show includes recent releases by death
metal group exodus and wasp, latter of which, baker noted, recently
landed a lucrative pact with capitol records, and an lp by the
california-based punkish dead kennedys.  lp contains a poster,
graphically depicting the sexual act, that baker described as "shocking"
and "obscene."

from the letters column

who's saving whom?

i realize that you are probably tired of receiv ing letters about the
p.m.r.c..  howev er, as the mother of two teenagers, i would like to
express an opinion.  a year ago, parents such as myself were concerned
that their children were listening to prince and madonna.  however,
since the p.m.r.c. suggested that albums be labeled, record companies
have taken full advantage of the situation.  last week, i found an album
called satan's revenge under my 14-year-old's bed.  it was enough bait
to arouse the interest of any rebellious teenager.

 since the p.m.r.c. got involved in the music industry, nothing has
changed except that it is easier for people to spot albums with
objectionable contents.  this may explain why my teenage boys have
switched from listening to madonna and prince to slayer and executioner.
